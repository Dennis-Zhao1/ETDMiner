The  semiconductor  industry’s  continued  trend  of  manufacturing  device  features  on  the 
nanometer scale requires increased plasma processing control and improved understanding of 
plasma characteristics and plasma-surface interactions. This dissertation presents a series of 
experimental results for focus studies conducted in an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) system. 
First novel “on-wafer” diagnostic tools are characterized and related to plasma characteristics. 
Second, plasma-polymer interactions are characterized as a function of plasma species and 
processing parameters. Complimentary simulations accompany each focus study to supplement 
experimental findings. 
 
Wafer heating mechanisms in inductively coupled molecular gas plasmas are explored with 
PlasmaTempTM,  a  novel  “on-wafer”  diagnostic  tool.  Experimental  wafer  measurements  are 
obtained with the PlasmaTempTM wafer processed in argon (Ar) and argon-oxygen (Ar/O ) 
2
mixed plasmas. Wafer heating mechanisms were determined by combining the experimental 
measurements with a 3-dimensional heat transfer model of the wafer.  Comparisons between 
pure Ar and Ar/O  plasmas demonstrate that two additional wafer heating mechanisms can be 
2
important  in  molecular  gas  plasmas  compared  to  atomic  gas  discharges.    Thermal  heat 
conduction from the neutral gas and O-atom recombination on wafer surface can contribute as 
much as 60 % to wafer heating under conditions of low-energy ion bombardment in molecular 
plasmas. 
 
Measurements of a second novel “on-wafer” diagnostic sensor, the PlasmaVoltTM, were tested 
and  validated  in  the  ICP  system  for  Ar  plasmas  varying  in  power  and  pressure.  Sensor 
measurements were interpreted with a numerical sheath simulation and comparison to scaling 
laws  derived  from  the  inhomogeneous  sheath  model.  The  study  demonstrates  sensor 
measurements are proportional to the RF-current through the sheath and the scaling is a function 
of sheath impedance. PlasmaVoltTM sensor measurements are proportional to the square root of 
the plasma density at the plasma-sheath interface, one-fourth root of the electron temperature, 
and one-fourth root of the RF bias voltage under conditions where the sheath is predominantly 
capacitive. When the sheath impedance becomes increasingly resistive, the sensor measurements 
deviate from the scaling law and tend to be directly proportional to the plasma density.

Vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) emissions in Ar ICPs are characterized and the chemical and physical 
modifications  to  193  nm  photoresist  (PR)  polymer  materials  processed  in  Ar  ICPs  are 
investigated. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) transmission measurements as a function of 
VUV photon fluence demonstrate that VUV-induced bond breaking occurs over a period of time.  
A numerical model demonstrates that VUV photons deplete near-surface O-containing bonds, 
leading to deeper, subsequent penetration and more bond losses, while the remaining near-
surface C–C bonds absorb the incident radiation and slow VUV photon penetration.  
 
The roughening mechanism of blanket and patterned 193 nm PR samples are explored in a well 
characterized Ar ICP.  FTIR and atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis of plasma processed 
193  nm  PR  suggests  that  ion-induced  generation  of  a  graphitized  layer  at  high  energies, 
combined  with  VUV  bulk  modification  of  193  nm  PR  may  initiate  PR  roughening.  The 
roughness of blanket samples increases as a function of VUV fluence, ion energy, and substrate 
temperature.  Line width roughness (LWR) measurements of patterned samples demonstrate a 
similar trend suggesting that LWR may correlate with surface roughness of patterns. The results 
are  compared  to  PR  studies  previously  conducted  in  an  ultra-high  vacuum  beam  system 
demonstrating that the vacuum beam system is a useful tool that can deconvolute and simplify 
complex plasma systems.

Acknowledgements 
 
The number of people who have helped me with this endeavor over the past five years here at 
Berkeley is overwhelming and I find myself feeling very fortunate to have been surrounded by 
such supportive and inspiring family and friends.  
 
First I would like to thank my advisor, David Graves, for allowing me the opportunity to study in 
his research group and to work on such novel, challenging, and industry relevant projects. 
Without his continued guidance and encouragement to steer me through my mental roadblocks, 
this work would not have been possible. I have been inspired by his enthusiasm for pursuing new 
ideas and have learned what it means to be a good researcher. 
 
I’d also like to thank Cheng-Che Hsu for teaching me everything about the ICP system; his 
guidance was instrumental in providing me with the fundamental knowledge that I would use in 
all of my future experimental studies. In addition I would like to thank John Coburn, Harold 
Winters, and Dave Fraser for their expertise and insights. On numerous occasions I would find 
myself turning to them for advice whenever I’d be modifying or trouble-shooting the ICP system 
and designing new experimental setups.  
 
The Graves’ group – past and present – have made this research experience most memorable. 
The antics that ensued in our lab, the laughs that we’ve shared, and the disasters that we’ve 
survived have made working two floors underground, in the dungeon, more tolerable than it 
would have been otherwise.  
 
Thank you to all of my friends – new and old – who listened to me gripe, provided entertainment, 
and kept me relatively sane.  I won’t list you all for fear of forgetting someone, but please know 
that without the dinners, dancing, hiking, shopping sprees, sight-seeing, and game nights I would 
not have survived. 
 
Last, but not least, I’d like to thank my parents, Mark and Mieko, and my brother, Marcus. Their 
continued love and support have made this journey possible. Words cannot describe how much 
I’ve missed home, but their encouragement always lifted my spirits and motivated me to achieve 
my goal. This accomplishment is ours to share. I love you all.

Chapter 1 – Introduction 
 
 
1.1   The Semiconductor Industry 
 
Every  two  years  the  number  of  transistors  on  a  microprocessor  doubles  while  the  critical 
dimensions (CD) of these features shrink by 0.7 times. This trend is known as Moore’s law and 
is  the  primary  source  of  motivation  for  the semiconductor industry. As a result, engineers 
manufacture more dies per wafer, on increasingly larger wafers, at a reduced cost. In addition, 
shrinking CDs have increased the number density of features to the hundreds of millions. As 
transistors are packed more densely, they leak less energy, produce less heat and switch faster. 
Thus consumers benefit in purchasing inexpensive microprocessors that run faster, use less 
power, and are more energy-efficient. 
 
Key changes in the fabrication of these small features (i.e. transistors) have allowed the 
semiconductor industry to keep pace with Moore’s law and develop technology nodes now on 
the  nanometer  (nm)  scale.  Technological  and  material  changes  were  made  in  the 
photolithography, or patterning, step including the development and use of new photoresists and 
light sources.  Simultaneously, technological changes in the etching, or pattern transfer, step 
including the use of plasmas were initiated, and has also allowed for fabrication of densely 
packed, nanometer-scale features. However, it is growing increasingly difficult to keep pace with 
Moore’s law as the features are nearing the 22 nm technology node where transistor gate lengths 
are on the order of 15 nm1.  High quality pattern transfer of these small features will require 
more stringent control of processing variables in the photolithography and etching steps and a 
better understanding of plasma-wafer interactions. Both experimental and modeling studies of 
plasma-surface interactions will become invaluable as engineers seek solutions to increasingly 
complex challenges in manufacturing high-quality, low-cost devices.

1.2   Photolithography 
 
Photolithography is a series of steps used to pattern integrated circuits, comprised of numerous 
features often tens of nanometers in dimension. First, a film (e.g. metal) is deposited on the 
substrate surface (Figure 1.1a) and is then followed by photoresist (PR) deposition (b). The PR is 
optically irradiated through a patterned mask (c) with a light source of specified wavelength. The 
exposed area is then developed away by chemical means (d). The pattern left in the PR, is 
transferred to the underlying film by a subsequent etching process. Traditionally, etching was 
accomplished by dipping the substrate into a liquid bath where a vigorous chemical reaction 
between the liquid and exposed material yields the feature shape. The pattern, however is not 
faithfully transferred because the chemical reaction etches in all directions at the same rate 
(isotropic etching)2. This may result in feature undercutting (e). In the past when typical feature 
dimensions were several micrometers in length significant undercutting could occur without 
severely  affecting  device  performance.    However,  current  nanometer-scale  features  are  so 
densely packed that undercutting can lead to electronic interference between adjacent features, 
and ultimately device failure.  Thus, anisotropic etching (f) is essential for high quality pattern 
transfer and is accomplished with a plasma etching tool. 
 
Significant  changes  in  photolithography  technology  have  allowed  the  semiconductor 
industry to keep pace with Moore’s law, including changes in the light sources used during 
optical  exposure.    Photolithographers  observed  that  shorter  light  wavelengths  improved  the 
resolution of small features; therefore wide-band light sources of constant illumination were 
preferentially replaced with Hg-arc lamps (emitting wavelengths at 436 nm and 365 nm) for 
patterning micrometer length-scale features (Table 1.1).  Eventually Hg-arc lamps were replaced 
with KrF (248 nm) and ArF (193 nm) excimer laser light sources for patterning nanometer 
length-scale features3.

The change to lower wavelengths was accompanied by a change in photoresist (PR) 
chemistry. With Hg-arc lamps, features were patterned with diazonaphthoquinone (DNQ) PRs. 
However, for patterning with KrF excimer light sources, all of the photons (300 – 450 nm) 
necessary for photo-induced reactions in the PR were not available.  Photolithographers were 
required to enhance the photoreactions by changing the polymer chemistry and this resulted in 
the chemically amplified 248 nm PR.  With the use of ArF excimer lamps, 248 nm PR proved 
unsuitable as it was far too absorbent of 193 nm wavelength light. The PR chemistry required 
increased concentrations of oxygen to reduce the absorbency of 193 nm light; 193 nm PR 
resulted3. Ultimately, the change to ArF excimer lasers and 193 nm PRs, combined with other 
resolution enhancement techniques4, allowed photolithographers to pattern features down to 10’s 
of nanometers in the PR layer. 
 
193 nm PRs processed in plasmas during the etch step, however, unfortunately undergo 
severe  chemical  and  physical  modification,  causing  enhanced  roughness  of  the  PR5, 6.  The 
degradation  of  the  PR  (on  the  nanometer  scale)  prevents  faithful  pattern  transfer  to  the 
underlying materials and that may result in device failure7. This is of increasing concern as CDs 
continue  to  shrink  beyond  the  32  nm  technological  node.  The  mechanism  of  193  nm  PR 
degradation in plasma processing environments is not well understood and is the focus of many 
experimental studies in an effort to develop treatment or prevention recipes5-13.

1.3   Plasma Discharges 
 
Plasma discharges are utilized for anisotropic etching during pattern transfer. A plasma is a 
partially ionized gas consisting of several components, including ions, electrons, neutrals, and 
radicals.  Many of the plasmas used in the etching process are weakly ionized; the ionization 
fraction,  x  <<  1,  therefore  the  ion  (n)  and  electron  (n )  densities  (~109  –  1012  cm-3)  are 
i i e
magnitudes lower than the neutral gas density (n ). The bulk plasma, though, is considered quasi-
g
neutral as n ≈ n .  Both elastic and inelastic collisions take place between all species in the 
i e
plasma. One of the more important collision reactions is the electron-atom ionization: e–  + X → 
2e– + X+. This leads to a collision cascade where the reaction generates two electrons per 
collision  that  can  in  turn  react  and  produce  additional  electrons.  This  reaction  scheme  is 
important in sustaining the plasma.  However, only electrons that have energies greater than the 
ionization energy (ε ) and dissociation energy (ε ) can ionize an atom or dissociate a molecule, 
iz diss
respectively.  The electron energy is dependent upon the electron energy distribution function 
(EEDF) and is a function of the plasma operating condition.  
 
A plasma is generated inside a typical etch tool by feeding electrical power into a gas2. 
One common etch tool is the inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etch tool typically used for 
etching processes that define the gate-electrode region. A simple schematic of an ICP is shown in 
Figure 1.2.  A radio-frequency (RF) current is driven through the coils above the dielectric 
window at the top of the chamber. This couples the inductive field to the plasma2. Power 
transferred from the fields to the few free electrons initially within the gas excites the electrons to 
higher energies. These high energy electrons can then ionize the neutrals and initialize the 
collision cascade, thus creating and sustaining the plasma.

Initially within the system, the electrons rapidly move throughout the chamber and are 
lost to the walls, as opposed to the slower (heavier) ions. In order to maintain quasi-neutrality, i.e. 
an equal net flow of ions and electrons toward a surface, a confining potential (Ф) forms. This 
potential acts to repel the electrons back to the bulk, while accelerating the ions toward the walls, 
and ultimately forms a region of net positive charge: the sheath2, 14. The sheath thickness is on 
the order of a few Debye lengths, typically a few millimeters.  The ion acceleration energy is 
typically 10 – 40 V, which is equivalent to the dc plasma potential (Ф ). One of the key features 
p
of an ICP tool is the ability to control the ion energy by separately biasing the lower electrode 
where the substrate sits.  Biasing the lower electrode increases the potential drop within the 
sheath. An ion falling through this potential drop will bombard the substrate surface with the 
equivalent potential drop energy15, i.e. an ion falling through a 1 V potential drop gains 1 eV in 
kinetic energy. Therefore, in a low pressure system (collisions between species are minimized in 
the sheath) where the substrate is negatively biased, anisotropic etching can be accomplished.     
 
 
1.4   Plasma & Wafer Diagnostics – Metrology 
 
Although high-quality pattern transfer is more readily accomplished with a plasma etching tool, 
obtaining  uniform  pattern  transfer  across  200  –  300  mm  diameter  wafers  is  extremely 
challenging because practical control of these systems requires tuning of a number of process 
parameters, such as power, pressure, chemistry, and flow rates. A change in a single parameter 
may result in numerous changes to how plasma species behave and interact with the substrate. 
Automated control schemes are often very complicated and require several diagnostic tools to 
monitor both the plasma and wafer product16-18.  Plasma and wafer diagnostic tools may be 
available in-line, in-situ, and ex-situ where each type of metrology has its respective merits and 
drawbacks. 
 
 
1.4.1   Wafer Diagnostics 
 
Traditionally, examination of wafer response to process control parameters of plasma etching 
tools used monitor or dummy wafers. These are a series of wafers inserted into production flow 
in  place  of  production  grade  wafers  and  typically  comprise  20  –  40  %  of  a  fab’s  total 
throughput17, 19.  Once a monitor wafer is processed, ex-situ metrology such as scanning electron 
microscopy (SEM), spectrophotometry, and spectroscopic ellipsometry is employed to determine 
critical  feature  dimensions,  film  thickness,  and  etching  uniformity  (Table  1.2)20,  21.    The 
advantages of these ex-situ monitoring techniques are the high-degrees of accuracy and ability to 
directly measure the wafer change in response to plasma processing conditions. Unfortunately, 
these  post-processing  analysis  techniques  are  time  consuming  and  delays  in  monitor-wafer 
characterization may prevent timely detection and correction of drifting processes.   
 
There is a large trend towards in-situ and in-line metrology to complement monitor 
wafers for wafer processing and tool control.  In-situ and in-line metrology employs diagnostic 
tools that are physically built or attached to the plasma etch tool.  For example, the devices may 
be present in the load/lock chamber for pre or post processing measurements or mounted on the 
reactor wall.  In-line sensors that monitor the wafer are categorized as “wafer state” sensors22.  A 
5
wafer state sensor monitors changes directly observed on the wafer surface, such as etch rates or 
film  thickness.  Examples  of  such  sensors  include  but  are  not  limited  to  reflectometers, 
ellipsometers, and scatterometers (Table 1.2)16, 21, 23.  The benefits of in-line metrology include 
improved process monitoring, reduced product variance, and higher throughput19.  The drawback 
is that the entire wafer cannot be monitored and observed measurements (e.g. etch rate) are for 
single locations. Furthermore, due to design restrictions or financial limitations, installation of 
in-line “wafer-state” sensors are not always practical. 
 
An alternative to monitor wafers and in-line “wafer-state” sensors are a new metrology 
tool called “on-wafer” sensors.  These are wafers with sensors embedded onto the wafer surface, 
capable of measuring wafer parameters (e.g. temperature) at different radial positions (Table 1.2). 
These sensors wafers are inserted into production flow along with product wafers and act as 
autonomous measuring devices capable of capturing the temporal evolution of wafer processing 
states in real time. Real time, in-situ measurements at the wafer level improves diagnostic 
capabilities without requiring any integration of additional equipment to the plasma etching tools, 
saving both time and operational expenses19, 24.  Furthermore, establishing the temporal and 
spatial evolution of wafer-surface will allow for more finely tuned control of the processing 
equipment. This will be necessary as feature dimensions continue to grow smaller and more 
compact.   
 
 
1.4.2   Plasma Diagnostics 
 
Monitoring plasma response to process control parameters, such as pressure, power, and flow 
rate are important since wafer uniformity can be controlled, for example, with the resulting 
etching rates or deposition rates. Therefore, there is a large effort to measure bulk plasma 
characteristics with traditional, in-line and in-situ techniques, or with new emerging technology 
“on-wafer” sensors. 
 
 Bulk  plasma  characteristics  such  as  electron  density  and  temperature  are  typically 
monitored with in-line or in-situ metrology tools. Similar to the “wafer-state” metrology tools, 
these diagnostic tools are mounted in or on the chamber and are called “process state” sensors.   
The process state sensor monitors the plasma’s response to changes in the process control 
parameters; e.g. they may detect gas phase reactants and product species, bulk temperatures and 
densities, with residual gas analyzers (RGA), optical emission spectrometers (OES) or Langmuir 
probes, respectively23, 25-28(Table 1.3).  The benefits of in-line metrology include improved real-
time monitoring of the plasma that reduces product variance and increases throughput19.  Again, 
however, the metrology may be limited to line-of-sight measurements and may not directly 
account for the spatial variation across the plasma tool.  
 
“On-wafer” sensors are also used to monitor the plasma in addition to wafer response. 
These “on-wafer” sensors have the potential to measure plasma characteristics, such as electron 
density,  above  the  wafer  surface,  providing  information  on  both  the  temporal  and  spatial 
variation of the plasma29. As this is yet an emerging technology, much study of these sensors is 
required.  However, use of these sensors to couple plasma characteristics to sensor measurements 
will give significant insight on how to control a plasma etch tool for a desired wafer result.

1.5   Numerical Modeling 
 
The complexities of plasma discharges are extensive, covering a range of topics from gas-phase 
kinetics, mass and heat transport, and plasma chemistry. It is clear from experimental studies 
that a deeper understanding of plasma discharges and improvement of process control requires 
investigation of time and space variations. Thus numerical models of plasmas and plasma-
surface interactions are of increasing importance as engineers strive to improve fabrication of 
nanometer-scale devices.    
 
Fluid47, finite element48, and particle-in-cell simulations have been widely used to study 
bulk plasma physics in inductively coupled and capacitively coupled discharges2. The effects of 
process  control  parameters  such  as  power  and  pressure  on  electron  energy  distribution 
functions49, recombination rates of species on surfaces47, and formation of concentration and 
thermal  gradients  have  been  investigated.  Increasingly,  plasma-surface  interactions  are 
simulated to study the effects of bulk plasma characteristics on the wafer surface. For example, 
sheath simulations are a useful tool in studying ion energy distributions50, ion currents and 
trajectories51,  and  potential  drops52,  which  can  directly  impact  etching  rates  and  wafer 
uniformity. Lastly, as feature density increases and critical dimensions shrink, the capability to 
control the evolution of patterns in plasma discharges is of increasing interest. Many simulation 
studies model profile evolution and the effects of ion angles and deposition and recombination 
of species on the patterns53. Feature evolution can also be investigated on the microscopic level 
with molecular dynamic simulations54.  
 
 
1.6   Thesis Outline 
 
This  dissertation  work  focuses  on  plasma  and  wafer  diagnostics  as  a  method  to  improve 
understanding of process control parameter effects on bulk plasma characteristics and wafer 
response.  Three  focus  studies  using  a  combination  of  experimental  work  in  an  inductively 
coupled plasma and numerical simulations will be presented. The first two focus studies will 
concentrate on a novel technology, “on-wafer” sensors. The third focus study examines plasma-
surface  interactions  and  will  concentrate  on  193  nm  photoresists  processed  in  inductively 
coupled plasmas. Chapter 2 provides an overview of the experimental apparatus and diagnostic 
tools utilized in all of the focus studies. In addition, Chapter 3 provides data analysis techniques 
and characterizes an Ar ICP that may be of use for future users of the inductively coupled plasma 
chamber and its accompanying diagnostic tools. 
 
 
1.6.1   “On-wafer” Sensors 
 
Recent commercial developments now provide a powerful platform – “on-wafer” sensors – that 
allows quasi-real time and in-situ measurements of plasma and wafer characteristics.  Because 
this technology is relatively new, much work remains to develop truly reliable sensors that can 
relate sensor measurements to plasma dynamics and process control variables.  However, it can 
be readily anticipated that this technology will be the new front in wafer and plasma metrology 
8
with the ultimate goal of developing sensors capable of measuring feature etching rates and 
feature profile evolution. 
 
Two  commercially  manufactured  “on-wafer”  sensors,  the  PlasmaTempTM  and 
PlasmaVoltTM, are investigated and the results are coupled with numerical simulations of an 
inductively coupled plasma, sheath, and wafer heat-transport in order to increase confidence in 
and understanding of the experimental measurements. The objective was to correlate sensor 
measurements to plasma characteristics (such as ion flux and electron density) and to process 
control  parameters  (such  as  power  and  bias  voltages).    Both  qualitative  and  quantitative 
agreement between sensor measurements and numerical simulations demonstrate that “on-wafer” 
sensors are powerful diagnostic tools that can be interpreted to yield much more than face-value 
measurements. 
 
Specifically,  Chapter  4  will  focus  on  the  PlasmaTempTM  studies  and  address  wafer 
heating mechanisms in inductively coupled, molecular-gas plasmas. Chapter 5 will focus on the 
PlasmaVoltTM studies and demonstrate that sensor measurements can be coupled to plasma 
density. Appendices A and B contain supplemental experimental data and simulation user guides 
for the PlasmaTempTM and PlasmaVoltTM focus studies, respectively. In addition, Appendix C 
outlines a numerical simulation of the ICP system used to study Ar and Ar/O  plasma discharges 
2
in the PlasmaTempTM study and outlines the modifications made to study the generation of Ar-
metastable species. 
 
 
1.6.2   193 nm Photoresist 
 
Current photolithography standards use ArF excimer lasers and 193 nm photoresist (PR) for 
patterning features on the nanometer scale. Research has shown that 193 nm PRs processed in 
plasmas during the etch step are less etch resistant and experience significant chemical and 
physical modification5, 55-58. The degradation and roughening of 193 nm PR is of increasing 
concern as the roughness prevents the pattern from being faithfully transferred to the underlying 
layer and is increasingly becoming of the same order as the feature size. Many studies have 
explored the cause of 193 nm PR roughening and have attributed it to synergistic effects between 
energetic ion bombardment and vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photon irradiation6, 10. 
 
Chapter 6 characterizes the VUV emissions from an inert Ar plasma and measures the 
effects  on  193  nm  PR.  Chapter  7  presents  a  numerical  simulation  modeling  the  VUV 
photoabsorption behavior of 193 nm PR. Chapter 8 focuses on the synergistic roughening effects 
due to VUV photons and ions, and effects of varying process control parameters. A roughening 
mechanism for 193 nm PR is proposed. Appendix C also contains updates to the ICP numerical 
model that allows for monitoring of both metastable and resonance states of Ar. Comparison 
between experimental and simulated VUV fluxes are demonstrated.

Chapter 2 – The Inductively Coupled Plasma System 
& Diagnostic Tools 
 
 
2.1   Abstract 
 
This chapter will introduce the reader to the inductively coupled plasma system used in these 
studies,  along  with  the  installed  diagnostic  tools  that  allow  for  plasma  characterization. 
Diagnostic tools include a wall-mounted ion current probe, an optical emission spectrometer 
(OES),  a  vacuum  ultraviolet  (VUV)  spectrometer,  an  ion  mass  spectrometer  (IMS),  an 
appearance potential mass spectrometer (APMS), a quartz-crystal microbalance (QCM), and a 
Langmuir probe.  Data analysis techniques are provided with each equipment description. 
 
 
2.2   Inductively Coupled Plasma Chamber 
 
The inductively coupled plasma (ICP) system used in these studies was originally built by former 
graduate student Harmeet Singh59, and previously modified and used by former graduate student 
Cheng-Che Hsu to study etching of ruthenium coatings in O  and Cl  containing plasmas48.  The 
2 2
ICP reactor consists of a cylindrical, stainless steel chamber, 20 cm in diameter and 10 cm in 
height (Figure 2.1). The process gas enters through an annulus at the chamber top and the 
pressure is controlled by modulating the gas flow rate at the chamber outlet. The chamber 
pressure (1 – 100 mT) is measured with an MKS Baratron (type 660) capacitance manometer 
gauge.  The plasma chamber is pumped by a 1000 L/s Seiko-Seiki turbo pump, backed by a 
mechanical roughing pump. A typical base pressure of ~ 5 × 10-7 Torr is achieved. 
 
The plasma density and ion energy are controlled with two, independent, radio frequency 
(RF) power sources. First, a five-turn planar coil delivers 13.56 MHz RF power through the 
alumina dielectric window at the chamber top. A Faraday shield placed between the coil and the 
dielectric plate minimizes the capacitive coupling. The set power and pressure control the plasma 
density. A bias voltage is delivered through the second 13.56 MHz power source through the 
stainless steel electrode (chuck) at the chamber bottom.  This bias voltage independently controls 
10
ion bombarding energies and is measured with a 1000x 3pF attenuated high voltage probe 
(Tektronix P6015) and recorded by a Tektronix TDS 2022B oscilloscope. Wafers (up to 150 mm 
in diameter) are mechanically clamped to the chuck. Backside helium cooling is available to 
improve heat transfer between the wafer and chuck. 
 
The ICP chamber is equipped with sampling ports located 2.54 cm above the lower 
electrode surface (Figure 2.2). Diagnostic tools include a wall-mounted ion current probe, an 
optical emission spectrometer (OES), a vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) spectrometer, an ion mass 
spectrometer (IMS) and a neutral mass spectrometer. In addition, a port equipped with a radial-
motion, linear feed-through system can be interchanged with a sample holder, Langmuir probe 
and a quartz-crystal microbalance (QCM).  
 
 
2.3   Sample Holder 
 
A temperature and bias controlled sample holder can be mounted in the radial-motion, linear 
feed-through port (Figure 2.3). Samples (1 – 2 cm2) are mounted on the 1.1-inch diameter holder 
in the load-lock chamber, and translated into the ICP system until flush at the chamber wall. The 
holder temperature (0 – 100 °C) is controlled with an external Neslab RTE-111 water bath.  
Samples are held on the holder with thermal paste (Apiezon H Hi Temp Vacuum Grease) and 
kapton tape. The bias is controlled with a 13.56 MHz RF power supply, measured with a high 
voltage probe and recorded by a Tektronix TDS 2022B oscilloscope. 
 
 
2.4   Quartz Crystal Microbalance 
 
A quartz crystal microbalance is available to measure mass change corresponding to material 
etching or deposition. Although not used in this study, a brief description will be given herein. 
For detailed operation, the reader is referred to the dissertation of Hsu48.  
 
A Phelps Electronics (model 18020) quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) is exchangeable 
with the previously described sample holder, as well as with the Langmuir probe in the radial-
motion, linear feed-through port mounted on the chamber wall. The microbalance head supports 
6  MHz  Au-coated  quartz  crystals,  monitored  for  changes  in  oscillation  frequency  via  a 
thickness/rate monitor (STM-100/MF, Sycon Instruments) interfaced with a PC. The Au-coated 
quartz crystals are transferred to the microbalance through the load-lock chamber (cf Figure 2.2) 
isolated from the main chamber via a gate valve, and pumped down with a supporting roughing 
pump. The samples are translated into the ICP chamber to sit flush at the reactor wall. The 
microbalance head is cooled through an external water supply to prevent changes in frequency 
oscillations due to ion bombardment induced sample heating. A 1 Hz change in the oscillation 
frequency corresponds to a mass change of 12.1 ng/cm2.

2.5   Langmuir Probe 
 
The Langmuir probe is introduced into the plasma chamber through the differentially pumped 
radial-motion, linear feed-through port (inter-exchangeable with the sample holder and QCM) 
and can access different radial positions ranging from the chamber center to edge (r = 0 cm to r = 
7.5 cm).  The probe is designed according to the guidelines of Godyak et al. by former graduate 
student Harmeet Singh27,38. The telescopic probe design ensures that probe measurements do not 
significantly perturb the plasma38,60,61 while the Faraday shield between the coil and plasma 
minimize the RF potential distortion59.    
 
The Langmuir probe is used to measure the electron temperature (T ), electron density 
e
(n ) and plasma potential (Φ ) by measurement of the electron energy probability function 
e p
(EEPF) and application of the second derivative method27,38.  For this purpose, a platinum wire 
tip (125 μm diameter, ~ 5 mm length) performs a voltage sweep, V , measuring the collected 
p
current, I  (Figure 2.4).

2.6   Ion Current Probe 
 
A 0.4 cm2 wall-mounted, planar, ion current probe is DC-biased to −40 V to measure the total 
positive ion current.  A 2 mm wide guard ring surrounding the probe and similarly biased to – 40 
V is used to suppress edge effects25. The temporal evolution of the DC ion current is recorded 
with an Agilent 34410A 6½-digit multimeter and allows for measurement of plasma stability. 
15
The absolute value of a specific specie’s ion flux can be determined with the total positive ion 
flux and the known percentages of each ion specie as measured by the ion mass spectrometer.  
 
 
2.7   Ion Mass Spectrometer 
 
A UTI-300C quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) is used to monitor positive ion species 
emitted from a plasma. A detailed description of the QMS setup can be found in the dissertations 
of Singh59 and Hsu48. In brief, the QMS is differentially pumped with a 500 L/s turbomolecular 
pump (Pfeiffer Balzers TPU-510 with TCP-380 controller) producing a base pressure at the 
quadrupole mass filter, typically 10-8 – 10-7 Torr.  Ion species are sampled (collisionlessly) 
through a 325 μm aperture in the chamber side wall and guided to the detector with charged ion 
lenses (cf Figure 2.1). The lenses focus the ion flux into the quadrupole filter while the voltages 
applied to the lenses amplify the ion signal. QMS detection of ion species is applicable for low 
pressure (~ 3 – 25 mT) plasma conditions. At higher pressures (> 40 mT) the plasma neutral 
density scatters the ion flux and the QMS ion signal is lost.  
 
A mass scan of the ion signal is performed, detecting ions with varying mass to charge 
ratios. The resulting energy vs. intensity data is acquired on a PC with a Keithley-Metrabyte 12-
bit analog-to-digital board (Figure 2.9). By identifying known ion emissions (e.g. Ar ion 40 amu 
and 80 amu) in the plasma and the corresponding peaks in the energy vs. intensity spectra, the 
energy is converted to the respective mass signal via a linear relationship (Figure 2.10).  The 
intensity  signal  is  corrected  for  transmission  and  detection  efficiencies  provided  by  the 
manufacturer (Figure 2.11). The transmission efficiency (TE) for ions < 32 amu is 1 while ion 
masses > 32 amu varies as 10(32-m)/155. The detection efficiency (DE) varies as m-0.45.  The 
detected ion signal is proportional to the ion flux originating from the plasma, therefore the 
percentage of each ion species emitted from the plasma can be determined (Figure 2.12).

2.8   Appearance Potential Mass Spectrometer 
 
A Hiden Analytical PIC300 quadrupole mass spectrometer is mounted in cross-beam mode and 
attached to the ICP system (cf Figures 2.1 and 2.2).  Although the appearance potential mass 
spectrometer (APMS) is not used in these studies, a brief description will be given here. For 
further details, refer to the dissertations of Singh59 and Hsu48.   
 
The  APMS  chamber  is  3-stage,  differentially  pumped.  The  first  two  stages  are 
differentially pumped with 200 L/s turbomolecular pumps (Seiko Seiki STP-H200C and Pfeiffer 
Balzers TPU-240 with controller TCP380).  The third stage, housing the quadrupole mass filter 
chamber, is pumped down with a 1000 L/s cryogenic pump (On-Board 8F, CTI-Cryogenics, 
Helix Technology Corp.).  The differentially pumped stages allow for improved signal to noise 
ratios. 
 
The neutral plasma species are sampled through a 900 μm diameter aperture in the 
chamber wall.  The APMS selectively ionizes species with an ionizer in line-of-sight with the 
sampling  aperture.  The  background  noise  is  measured  when  a  slotted-wheel,  rotary-beam 
chopper is rotated to block the beam signal. The rotary chopper is located in the third differential 
pumping stage between the ionizer and the aperture. 
   
The radical number density of species ‘X’ measured with the APMS is calculated with 
the following expression and respective variable definitions48,59:

2.9   Optical Emission Spectrometer 
 
The optical emission (OE) emitted from the plasma is collected with an Ocean Optics PC2000-
UV-VIS-ISA OES. A 2048 element, linear CCD array collects the electromagnetic spectrum 
ranging from 200 nm to 850 nm with a 1.5 nm FWHM resolution. The OE is collected with a 
collimating lens and guided through an optical fiber to the spectrometer that is interfaced (ISA-
bus) with a PC. The OES can capture a full spectrum in 1 ms, however the integral time is 
adjusted to achieve high signal to noise ratio for a desired acquisition rate.  
 
In these studies, the OES is used to monitor the plasma and ensure the plasma has 
reached steady-state soon after plasma ignition. The temporal evolution of a line emission is used 
to indicate plasma stability48.  In addition, the spectra are monitored for changes in plasma 
chemistry  due  to  chamber  contaminants  or  product  emissions  from  sample  surfaces.    For 
example the 420.06 nm and 811.5 emission lines of a pure Ar plasma are often monitored for 
plasma stability, while the 777.4 and 844.6 nm lines and 656.3 nm line are monitored for O  and 
2
H  contamination, respectively.

2.10   Vacuum Ultraviolet Spectrometer 
 
The plasma generated vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) emissions are monitored with a Resonance 
LTD VSFS92 VUV spectrometer mounted on a side-wall port, opposite the sample holder, with 
line-of-sight at 2.54 cm above the lower electrode surface (cf Figures 2.1 and 2.2). To minimize 
ion bombarding damage, the VUV spectrometer is offset from the main plasma chamber by a 
branch of specified distance (r). The VUV spectrometer is pumped down directly by the ICP 
chamber’s turbomolecular pump through the branch and spectrometer entrance slit (150 μm 
length).  The spectrometer is comprised of a concave holographic grating (1,800 grooves/mm) 
and linear CCD detector (0.2 × 28 mm).  
 
18
The  VUV  hardware  dial  may  be  adjusted  to  change  the  grating  and  the  respective 
wavelength collection window (ranging ~ 25 nm – 450 nm) (Figure 2.13). The calibration of the 
hardware was conducted for the wavelength range of 100 – 200 nm and for the purposes of these 
studies was maintained at the respective dial setting of 150. The integration time is adjusted to 
achieve high signal to noise ratio for a desired acquisition rate and tends to scale linearly with 
intensity (Figure 2.14).  
 
Calibration of the VUV spectrometer (with a NIST-calibrated CsI diode supplied by 
Resonance Ltd.) was completed in the ultra-high vacuum beam system for a Resonance Ltd. 
VUV source emitting high intensity 147 nm Xe VUV photons62.  The VUV emission from the 
plasma system was converted to an absolute VUV photon flux with the calibrated Xe VUV 
photon flux (2.14 × 1012 photons/cm2/s) to emission intensity (5731.45) ratio.  An integration 
time of 4,000 ms was used in the calibration. Any change to the integration time must be 
reflected in scaling the emission intensity accordingly. In addition, emission intensities must be 
corrected by the manufacture-recommended factor (S) of 10 for wavelengths < 120 nm due to 
decreasing spectrometer sensitivity.   
 
The VUV photon flux from the ICP system was also corrected for a solid-angle factor, 
accounting  for  the  spectrometer  offset  from  the  chamber  by  distance  ‘r ’  (Figure  2.15).

Chapter 3 – Argon Plasma Characterization 
 
 
3.1   Abstract 
 
A number of diagnostic tools were utilized to characterize the plasma for the PlasmaTempTM, 
and PlasmaVoltTM “on-wafer” studies, as well as the 193 nm photoresist (PR) studies. Diagnostic 
tools include the Langmuir probe, ion current probe, ion mass spectrometer, optical emission 
spectrometer  (OES)  and  vacuum  ultraviolet  (VUV)  spectrometer  that  have  been  previously 
described in Chapter 2. An Ar/O -mix plasma was investigated for the PlasmaTempTM study, in 
2
addition to the pure, inert Ar plasmas generated for all other studies.  In characterizing the 
plasmas, much attention was given in understanding effects of pressure and power on plasma 
species such as ions, metastables, and VUV photons. Effects of bias voltage application and 
Langmuir probe measurements on plasma stability were also investigated.  In this chapter the 
general characteristics of the Ar plasmas utilized in the “on-wafer” sensor studies and 193 nm 
PR studies are given. Supplementary reference data can be found in Appendices A and B. 
 
 
3.2   Langmuir Probe 
 
The plasma density (n ), electron temperature (T ) and plasma potential (Φ ) are measured 2.54 
e e p
cm above the lower electrode with the Langmuir probe for the pure Ar plasmas utilized in the 
PlasmaTempTM, PlasmaVoltTM and 193 nm PR experimental studies. The radial variation of the 
plasma characteristics were also investigated by linearly translating the probe from chamber 
center to edge. The effects of changing ICP power, operating pressure and plasma chemistry 
were investigated. Issues of plasma stability during Langmuir probe measurements were also 
considered. Scaling of the plasma density measurements to the lower electrode surface is also 
discussed. 
 
 
 
 
21
3.2.1   Power and Pressure Effects 
 
The n , T , and Φ  were measured for a range of operating conditions used in the PlasmaTempTM 
e e p
and PlasmaVoltTM studies. The dependence on power and pressure are given in Figures 3.1 – 3.3 
for Langmuir probe measurements taken at r = 0 cm (chamber center). Supplementary operating 
conditions and diagnostic measurements are given in Appendices A and B.  Note that n  is 
e
determined from an energy balance and is proportional to the total power absorbed, congruent 
with  the  global  model2.  In  contrast,  the  T   is  determined  by  particle  conservation  and  is 
e
independent of plasma density (or ICP power). 
 
n  measurements depend on radial position whereas T  and Φ  measurements remain 
e e p
fairly independent of radial position for Langmuir probe measurements 2.54 cm above the lower 
electrode surface. T  and Φ  values used in the PlasmaTempTM, PlasmaVoltTM, and 193 nm PR 
e p
studies neglect any spatial variation. However, significant spatial variation in n  is observed – as 
e
much as 50 % in high pressure cases and 30 % in low pressure cases. Figures 3.4 – 3.6 
demonstrate  radial  dependence  for  measurements  at  the  chamber  center  and  edge.  As  the 
operating pressure increases, the radial gradient of the density increases because the plasma 
transport becomes collisionally dominant. This produces a larger difference between center and 
edge density measurements.

3.2.2   Plasma Perturbation Effects 
 
Langmuir probe measurements introduce local plasma perturbations as the probe is translated 
into the plasma with the radial-motion, linear feed-though mechanism. Plasma density depletion 
around the probe scales as α/λ, were α is the probe radius and λ is the ion mean free path64. For 
i i
Ar plasmas, λ (in cm) is defined as 1/(330P), where P is the operating pressure in Torr2. The 
i
plasma perturbation can be neglected when α << λ. The density and ion current perturbations are 
i
typically ignored for a 10 mT Ar plasma where λ = 0.3 cm and α = 0.1 cm.  At 50 mT, λ = 0.06 
i i
cm, therefore, the perturbations become increasingly significant. For the relatively high pressure 
(50 – 90 mT) studies conducted in this dissertation, however, plasma density changes due to 
Langmuir probe perturbations are neglected. 
23
3.2.3   Scaling Experimental Measurements to Substrate Surfaces 
 
The Langmuir probe measurements are taken at 2.54 cm above the lower electrode (or wafer) 
surface,  giving  radial  profiles  of  the  bulk  plasma.  Many  of  the  studies,  including  the 
PlasmaTempTM and PlasmaVoltTM studies, require plasma density measurements at the wafer 
surface,  or  plasma-sheath  interface.  These  density  values  were  obtained  by  scaling  the 
experimentally measured density with a factor (R) obtained from a numerical simulation of the 
plasma (Table 3.1)48. The details of the numerical simulation are provided in Appendix C.

3.3   Ion Current Probe 
 
The ion current probe measures the positive ion flux to the wall as described in Chapter 2.  In 
general, the ion current probe is used to monitor plasma stability during the PlasmaTempTM, 
PlasmaVoltTM and 193 nm PR studies. Plasma perturbation is found typically during bias voltage 
application to the lower electrode and Langmuir probe measurements.  The changes to plasma 
density and ion current, however, were considered negligible for these studies.  
 
   
3.3.1   Effects of Power and Pressure 
 
ICP power deposition and chamber pressure effects on the ion current probe measurements are 
given in Figure 3.7. The ion current increases with power due to an increase in plasma density, 
and tends to increase linearly at higher powers. A slight increase in ion current is observed for 
higher pressures at ICP powers > 200 W.  As pressure increases, the radial gradient of the 
density increases because the plasma transport processes become collisionally dominant. This 
produces a larger difference between the chamber center and edge density values. Therefore, 
although the plasma center density increases, a significant change in ion current at the chamber 
wall is not observed due to the steep density gradient.  
 
Ion current for Ar/O -mix plasmas behave differently than in inert Ar plasmas.  The 
2
hollow data points represent ion current measurements for a 35 sccm:100 sccm Ar/O -mix 
2
plasma.  More power is required to maintain the Ar/O  plasma to achieve an approximately equal 
2
ion current compared to the Ar plasma because there are additional collisional energy loss 
mechanisms in a molecular gas, including excitation of vibrational and rotational energy levels, 
molecular dissociations and negative ion formation2.

3.3.2   Effects of Bias Voltage 
 
The temporal evolution of the ion current is monitored to ensure plasma stability for the duration 
of an experiment. The stability of the plasma may be disrupted due to application of a bias 
voltage on the lower electrode necessary for plasma ignition or substrate biasing. Figure 3.8 
depicts a typical ion current (or ion flux) measurement for a 10 mT, 70 W, Ar plasma. Plasma 
variation is minimal except for the initial 1~2 seconds. Biasing the lower electrode, required to 
supply enough capacitive coupling for plasma ignition, produces a burst in plasma density and 
ion current, as much as ~ 25 % times greater before reaching the stable condition.  
 
Bias voltages applied to the lower electrode (as in the PlasmaVoltTM studies) also result 
in ion current and plasma density instability. Typical changes in ion current measurements are 
given in Figure 3.9 for a 10 mT, 35 W and 155 W Ar plasma. Applied bias voltages are given in 
Table 3.2. The ion current increases in the low plasma density case (35 W) up to 22 %, while for 
the mid-range plasma density case (155 W) the ion current increases ~ 3%. For low density 
plasmas (e.g. 35 W) the ICP RF-power is equal to or less than the RF-bias power and capacitive 
coupling becomes increasingly important. Capacitive coupling increases electron heating and 
consequently the plasma density increases uniformly from chamber center to edge65.  In contrast, 
high density plasmas experience little-to-no capacitive coupling since RF-ICP power >> RF-bias 
power. Bias applications in high density plasmas tend to cause only the plasma density at the 
chamber center to decrease due to gas composition change65. For mid-range plasma densities (e.g. 
155 W) the two effects cancel each other out, and very little change is observed in plasma 
density during bias application65.

3.3.3   Effects of Surface Area 
 
Plasma density is not only dependent on ICP power and operating pressure, but also on the 
chamber geometry and surface area available for electron and ion loss. The dependency on 
surface area is most notable during Langmuir probe measurements as observed by the change in 
ion current (Figure 3.10). At (a) the plasma is ignited and reaches a stable operating condition, 
(b). As the Langmuir probe is inserted into the plasma (c) and measures the plasma density at 
varying chamber radii, r = 0 cm (d) and r = 5.8 cm (e), the available surface area for electron and 
ion loss increases, resulting in decreased plasma density and ion current. When the plasma 
density is measured at r = 0  and r = 5.8 cm, the wall ion current decreases by 12 % and 5 %, 
respectively, indicating that the Langmuir probe measured plasma densities are under-estimates 
of the true plasma density. 
 
As  discussed  previously  in  section  3.1.2,  Langmuir  probes  introduce  local  plasma 
perturbations, as is increasingly the case when the probe is translated into the plasma with the 
radial-motion, linear feed-through mechanism.  The perturbations are typically ignored for low 
pressure plasmas, and although they grow increasingly significant for higher pressures, the effect 
on plasma density and ion current is uncorrected in these studies.

3.4   Ion Mass Spectrometry 
 
Ion mass spectrometry (IMS) is utilized in the low-pressure conditions of the 193 nm photoresist 
(PR) studies.  In all studies, a pure Ar plasma at low pressure (10 mT) was generated and the 
plasma  ion  chemistry  prior  to  and  during  photoresist  processing  in  the  ICP  chamber  was 
measured.  The Ar plasma is typically inert, except for CO  and H O residual contaminants that 
2 2
ionize and generate C H O  ion species (Figure 3.11 a). When a PR sample is processed in the 
x y z
chamber, non-Ar+ peaks increase (Figure 3.11 b). The increase in C H O  species is attributed to 
x y z
possible  product  off-gassing,  as  well  as  CO   and  H O  contamination  introduced  when  PR 
2 2
samples are loaded through the side-wall, load-lock port.  
 
The fractions of each ion specie generated in a 10 mT, 70 W, Ar plasma are given in 
Table 3.3.  Increases in contaminant/product ion species are observed when a PR sample is 
introduced to the ICP chamber. The H O, CO, and ArH ion fractions increase by 3, 2, and 1.4 
2
times, respectively. With the total positive ion flux measured with the ion current probe (~ 5.15 × 
1015 ions/cm2/s) the individual ion flux can be calculated.

3.5   Optical Emission Spectrometry 
 
Optical emission spectrometry (OES) is used in addition to the ion current probe to monitor 
plasma stability. For example, the effects of bias voltage application to the lower electrode on 
plasma density can be clearly seen in increases of the Ar emission lines at 420.6 nm and 811.5 
nm. Other diagnostic techniques such as actinometry26 can be used to measure plasma density 
and understand the behavior of metastable and resonant states35.   
 
 
3.5.1   Plasma Stability Measurements 
 
Plasma stability is monitored by plotting the temporal evolution of emission line intensities. For 
pure Ar plasmas, the 420.6 nm, 750 nm and 811.5 nm emission lines are plotted as a function of 
time (Figure 3.12). As plasma “on” time increases, a drift in the plasma intensity (< 10 %) is 
observed due to an increase in plasma temperature (and chamber wall heating) and decrease in 
plasma density. This type of drift in the plasma density is considered negligible. 
 
Additional instabilities in the plasma are observed when the lower electrode is biased. 
Figure 3.13 plots the respective changes in the OES for a 10 mT, Ar plasma for the biases 
applied in Table 3.2. The observed change in the OES is similar to that observed in the ion 
current  measurements.  Applied  bias  voltages  at  low  plasma  densities  increase  the  electron 
heating from capacitive coupling. The resulting increase in plasma density is reflected in the 
increase in the OE intensity (Figure 3.13 a). At mid-densities, (155 W), the effect of bias voltage 
on plasma density is negligible (Figure 3.13 b).

3.5.2   Monitoring Plasma Resonance and Metastable States 
 
In addition to using OEs to monitor plasma stability, OEs are used to monitor the generation and 
consumption of resonance and metastable states. In particular, the OEs of the 1s  and 1s  
2 4
resonance states and 1s  and 1s  metastable states of an Ar plasma were monitored during the 
3 5
193 nm PR experiments (Table 3.4).   
 
At low pressures, the ratios of optical transitions to the 3p54s manifold from the 3p54p 
manifold (e.g. A/F, B/G, E/H) increase indicating that the plasma grows optically thick for 
transitions into the 1s  and 1s  resonance states (Figure 3.14). Under these conditions, the 1s  and 
2 4 3
1s metastable state densities increase. As the operating pressure is increased, the metastable-to-
5 
resonance state line ratios (i.e. A/F, B/G, E/H) tend to decrease. This is accompanied by an 
increase in the 1s  and 1s resonance state densities. The densities increase until they saturate and 
2 4 
begin to decrease slightly for very large pressures.  The variation of the OE line ratios measured 
in the ICP chamber are in good agreement with work done by Schulze, et al35.   
 
Figures 3.15 – 3.17 show the ratio of VUV (104.8 nm and 106.7 nm) emission intensities 
to OE intensities emitted during transition from the 3p54p to 3p54s manifold, i.e. 1s  and 1s  
2 4
generation.  As the pressure is increased from 10 mT to 50 mT, the ratios decrease. Therefore, 
the optical thickness for line emissions into the ground state is greater than for emissions into the 
1s  and 1s states, further increasing the 1s  and 1s  densities. As power is increased, 1s  and 1s
2 4  2 4 3 5 
densities tend to remain constant while 1s  and 1s  densities increase until saturation35.

3.6   Vacuum Ultraviolet Spectrometry 
 
Vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) spectroscopy is used to monitor wavelength emissions in the 80 nm 
to 210 nm range, as discussed in Chapter 2, and is used primarily in the 193 nm PR studies. The 
193 nm PR studies required measurements of the absolute VUV photon flux emitted from a 
plasma in order to study the chemical and physical effects of VUV photons and energetic ions on 
the PR. For the purposes of those experiments, a nearly pure, relatively inert Ar plasma was 
generated and the VUV emissions were characterized. Reported observations of VUV intensities 
for pure Ar plasmas focus on the dominant 104.8 nm and 106.7 nm emission lines66-68.  To 
prevent radical and ion damage to the spectrometer, chemically reactive plasmas, such as Ar/O  
2
mixtures were not observed. Process control parameters (e.g. ICP power deposition and pressure) 
were varied to monitor the effects on VUV photon generation. 
 
Figure 3.18 displays the VUV spectrum for an Ar plasma at 10 mT and a range of ICP 
powers. As power is increased, the dominant 104.8 nm and 106.7 nm Ar emission line intensities 
increase due to an increase in plasma density and excitation rates of 1s  and 1s  resonance states 
2 4
responsible for the VUV emissions69.  Furthermore, the intensities tend to increase with ICP 
power at higher powers for low pressures, while the VUV intensity appears to saturate at higher 
pressures (Figure 3.19). A VUV band from ~140 nm – 210 nm is likely due to carbon monoxide 
(CO) emissions from the 4th positive band70,71 and is a residual contaminant in the ICP system.  
The high intensity peaks at ~209 nm and 213 nm are double-peaks of the 104.8 nm and 106.7 nm 
emissions  and  is  an  artifact  of  the  spectrometer.  This  was  verified  by  inserting  a  MgF  
2
window36,72 with cut-off wavelength of 112 nm between the plasma source and the spectrometer 
(Figure 3.20).   
 
The VUV emission intensities are highly dependent on the operating pressure of the ICP 
system (Figure 3.21 and 3.22). The VUV peak intensities increase as pressure increases from 1 
mT to 10 mT and is attributed to the increasing plasma density that enhances 1s  and 1s  
2 4
production from ground state or other 1s levels69. The 104.8 nm and 106.7 nm peaks are distinct 
at  lower  pressures  and  merge  as  the  pressure  increases.  The  dominant  line  broadening 
mechanism  is  attributed  to  Doppler broadening for the range  of  powers  (0  –  200  W)  and 
pressures  investigated64.  As  pressure  increases  to  20  mT  and  50  mT,  the  peak  intensities 
decrease, apparently due to radiation trapping and an increase in quenching, and is congruent 
with the OE measurements (cf section 3.5.2). Absorption and quenching in the gas-filled region 
between the VUV spectrometer and the plasma also increases at higher pressure69,73,74. The 
dominating intensity of the 106.7 nm peak is attributed to its smaller absorption coefficient, 
typically four times less than the 104.8 nm peak64. 
 
Again, the band between 140 – 210 nm is attributed to CO VUV emissions from the 
fourth  positive  band.    As  the  pressure  is  varied,  the  CO  emission  intensifies  and  appears 
comparable to the Ar 104.8 nm and 106.7 nm emission lines.  However, the Ar emission 
intensity must be corrected by a factor of 10 to account for spectrometer sensitivity at lower 
wavelengths. Thus, integrating over both the Ar lines and CO-band emissions the CO-band 
intensity is at most 2.8 %, 2.5 %, 5.2 %, and 20.8 % the intensity of the Ar lines at 1, 10, 20, and 
50 mT, respectively.

Chapter 4 – Wafer Heating Mechanisms in a 
Molecular Gas, Inductively Coupled Plasma 
 
 
4. 1   Abstract 
 
In this chapter, measurements and modeling of wafer heating mechanisms in an Ar and Ar/O  
2
inductively coupled plasma (ICP) are reported. Experimental wafer temperature measurements 
are obtained with a commercially available on-wafer sensor system (PlasmaTempTM developed 
by KLA-Tencor) consisting of an on-board electronics module housing battery power and data 
storage with 30 temperature sensors embedded onto the wafer at different radial positions. This 
system allows for real-time, in-situ wafer temperature measurements. Wafer heating mechanisms 
were investigated by combining temperature measurements from the PlasmaTempTM sensor 
wafer with a 3D heat transfer model of the wafer and a model of the ICP. Comparisons between 
pure Ar and Ar/O  discharges demonstrated that two additional wafer heating mechanisms can 
2
be important in molecular gas plasmas compared to atomic gas discharges. The two mechanisms 
are heating from the gas phase and O-atom surface recombination. These mechanisms were 
shown to contribute as much as 60 % to wafer heating under conditions of low bias power.  This 
study demonstrated how the “on-wafer” temperature sensor not only yields a temperature profile 
distribution across the wafer, but can be used to help determine plasma characteristics, such as 
ion flux profiles or plasma processing temperatures.  
 
 
4.2   Introduction 
 
Wafer temperature control is an important parameter in the semiconductor industry, especially in 
plasma etching and deposition processes. It is well known that etching rates, uniformity and 
selectivity often have an Arrhenius-type dependence on wafer temperature2. Thus, temperature 
variation in the radial direction may introduce variations in critical feature dimensions across the 
wafer.  Many experimental and modeling studies have been conducted in order to establish an 
understanding of wafer temperature response to plasma processing conditions33,64,75-78. These 
cases often investigate heat transfer to, from, and within the wafer in processing regimes with 
35
relatively high source or bias power and inert atomic gases (such as Ar) where ion-bombardment 
and ion-electron recombination have been identified as the major source of heat transfer33,75,76,78. 
Wafer heating mechanisms in molecular gas plasmas, however, can involve effects in addition to 
those identified in atomic gas plasmas. These mechanisms include thermal conduction from the 
neutral gas, where bulk temperatures can be in excess of ~1000 K, and heat release associated 
with atom recombination on the wafer surface. 
 
The  ability  to  make  in-situ  measurements  of  the  wafer  temperature  during  plasma 
processing is therefore a powerful diagnostic tool.  The relative importance of wafer heating 
mechanisms can then be determined by combining experimental measurements of substrate 
temperatures with heat transport simulations and discharge physics calculations. This study 
utilizes the PlasmaTempTM sensor wafer that is capable of measuring wafer temperature profiles 
in-situ. The objective of this study was to determine the wafer heating effects in an Ar/O  
2
inductively coupled plasma over a range of gas pressures (70 – 90 mT) and source powers (70 – 
550 W), in the limit of no bias power. The following study demonstrates how a combination of 
experimental measurements and modeling of the PlasmaTempTM sensor, along with plasma 
diagnostics and modeling elucidate the various wafer heating mechanisms. 
 
 
4.3   Experimental Methods 
 
The experimental setup and diagnostic tools applied for this study have been described in detail 
in Chapter 2 and will be briefly reviewed here.  In addition, the experimental methodology 
employed  here  are  similar  to  a  previous  study  conducted  by  C.C.  Hsu  et  al.33  with  the 
PlasmaTempTM  under  pure  Ar  conditions  and  has  been  extended  to  study  Ar/O   plasma 
2
conditions.  
 
 
4.3.1   The “on-wafer” sensor: PlasmaTempTM 
 
PlasmaTempTM is a commercially available sensor tool developed by KLA-Tencor made of 
production grade silicon wafer, covered with a layer of thermal oxide. It contains 30 temperature 
sensors, located at different radial positions (see Appendix A) and also houses a battery and data 
storage module. The sensors are protected with a layer of polyimide coating and the electronic 
module is hermetically sealed. The module is used for high speed, autonomous data acquisition 
and wireless data transfer (Figure 4.1).  A 150 mm diameter version of the product is used for the 
present  experiments.  The  PlasmaTempTM  sensor  wafer  was  mechanically  clamped  to  the 
stainless steel chuck in a university built inductively coupled plasma (ICP) chamber.

4.3.2   Experimental Apparatus & Diagnostic Tools 
 
The ICP reactor consists of a cylindrical, stainless steel chamber, 20 cm in diameter and 10 cm in 
height. A five-turn planar coil delivers 13.56 MHz radio frequency (RF) power through the 
alumina dielectric window at the chamber top. A Faraday shield placed between the coil and the 
dielectric plate minimizes capacitive coupling. Backside helium (He) cooling was not used to 
cool the wafer in order to study the early transient temperature rise of the wafer.  Additional 
experimental measurements were obtained from a Langmuir probe used to measure the electron 
temperature (T ), electron density (n ) and sheath potential by measurement of the electron 
e e
energy probability function (EEPF) and application of the second derivative method27,38; an ion 
current probe used to measure the total positive ion current to the chamber surfaces33; and an 
optical emission spectrometer Ocean Optics PC2000-UV-VIS-ISA was used to monitor the 
plasma and ensure steady-state after plasma ignition.   
 
 
4.3.3   Experimental Conditions 
 
A series of experiments under the conditions displayed in Tables 4.1 and 4.2 were conducted to 
determine the wafer heating and cooling mechanisms in an Ar/O  mix plasma (see Appendix A 
2
for supplemental data). Approximately 70 % of the power listed in the tables (forward minus 
reflected power) is deposited into the ICP chamber48,59. The sensor wafer was exposed to a 
plasma for 30 seconds and the resulting temperature rise was observed to establish wafer heating 
trends.  Additional measurements, after the plasma was extinguished and processing gas turned 
off, were obtained to observe wafer cooling behavior. A pure Ar plasma was used as a basis for 
comparison to the Ar/O  plasma in order to distinguish relative heating contributions from ion-
2
bombardment  and  ion-electron  recombination  (the  main  mechanism  in  inert  atomic  gas 
plasma20,33), and thermal conduction and surface recombination (key additional mechanisms for 
molecular gas containing plasmas like O ). In order to simplify the comparison between the Ar 
2
and Ar/O  plasma cases, the total ion flux to the wafer surface was maintained constant so that 
2
heating contributions due to ion bombardment kinetic energy would be similar. Note that more 
37
power is required to maintain the Ar/O  plasma to achieve an approximately equal ion current 
2
compared to the Ar plasma because there are additional collisional energy loss mechanisms in a 
molecular  gas,  including  excitation  of  vibrational  and  rotational  energy  levels,  molecular 
dissociations and negative ion formation2 (cf Chapter 3, section 3.3.1).

A three-dimensional (3D) model of the PlasmaTempTM wafer was developed to simulate heat 
transfer  to,  from,  and  within  the  wafer.  In  a  previous  study  by  C.C.  Hsu  et  al.33  a  2D 
axisymmetric  model  of  the  sensor  wafer  was  utilized.  The  2D  axisymmetric  model  near-
quantitatively captures the wafer heating for short times (< 30 seconds); however, for longer 
times, the electronic module on the PlasmaTempTM (cf Figure 4.1) begins to act as a heat sink 
while heating or a heat source while cooling. The axisymmetry is thus lost for the longer time 
experiments,  necessitating  a  3D  model.  The  3D  model,  as  displayed  in  Figure  4.2,  more 
accurately accounts for the thermal properties of the wafer, sensors, and electronic module.  The 
3D model only differs in the addition of the electronic module, which is assumed to have quartz 
crystal thermal properties and is 3.94 cm in diameter and 3.6 mm thick. Therefore, the 3D model 
contains one additional transient thermal heat conduction equation to be solved and the reader is 
referred to C.C. Hsu et al.33 for a detailed description of the model setup. The key points of the 
model are briefly reviewed here.

Figure 4.2 A 3-dimensional model of the PlasmaTempTM sensor wafer. (a) Side view: The model consists of 5 
domains including a stainless steel chuck, a gap, Si wafer, polyimide coating, and an electronic module of 
thicknesses, 5 mm, 50 μm, 675 μm, 40 μm, and 3.6 mm, respectively. (b) The polyimide coating is modeled as 
concentric rings covering 42 % of the wafer.

near-quantitative agreement between the model predicted transient radial temperature profile and 
PlasmaTempTM measurements. The boundary conditions for all sides of the chuck, gap, wafer 
and polyimide coatings are set to be thermally insulated. The chuck bottom surface is defined as 
a constant temperature surface, T  = 300 K. The wafer surface, i.e. the exposed Si wafer, 
0
polyimide coatings, and electronic module experience an incident heat flux from the plasma. The 
sides of the electronic module are also defined as having an incident heat flux due to sheath 
formation around the electronic module.  The sheath forms between the quasi-neutral plasma 
region and the bounding chamber walls and also around plasma-immersed objects such as 
probes2,38. The sheath formation around immersed objects is, in general, geometry-dependent79. 
For simplicity, an incident heat flux is defined for the electronic module surface and sides, while 
ignoring any heat flux to the adjoining edges of the surfaces.  
 
The total heat flux to the wafer surface is the sum of a variety of heating mechanisms and 
is dependent on radial position and plasma type. For a pure Ar plasma it was found that there are 
two important heat sources: transfer of kinetic energy from the Ar ions (Ar+) and electrons (e-) 
bombarding  the  surface  and  the  absorption  of  energy  released  during  ion-electron 
recombination33,48. However, in molecular gas plasmas such as an Ar/O  plasma, there are 
2
additional heating mechanisms.  Ion and electron bombardment still play a significant role, 
therefore kinetic energy transferred from Ar+ and e- as well as from the molecular and atomic 
oxygen ions (O + and O+) will be important (q ). However, two new terms, thermal conduction 
2 ions
(q ) heating from the neutral gas, and O-atom recombination (q ) heating must also be 
cond rec
included.  
 
q  is important especially when bulk (neutral gas) temperatures are in excess of 1000 K.  
cond
The neutral gas temperature of molecular gas plasmas may exceed temperatures of equivalent 
density atomic gas plasmas due to additional heating mechanisms.  Heat may be transferred to 
the neutral gas via electron-neutral dissociation reactions, electron-neutral momentum transfer, 
electron-neutral energy transfer, ion-neutral energy transfer, gas phase thermochemistry and 
exothermic  wall  recombination  reactions28,80,81.    One  proposed  cause  of  the  neutral  gas 
temperature  increase  of  molecular  gas  plasmas  is  the  Franck-Condon  effect  and  inelastic 
40
collisions that lead to vibrational or rotational excitation of molecules28,80.  Franck-Condon 
heating occurs when electron-impact dissociation leads to dissociation products with excess 
kinetic energy. These hot dissociation products in turn heat the neutral species through collisions. 
Estimates  of  the  magnitude  of  this  heating  indicate  that  it  can  lead  to  peak  neutral  gas 
temperatures on the order of 1000 K. 
 
 q  is important because atoms can recombine on surfaces and release heat equivalent to 
rec
the molecule’s dissociation energy (ε ). Some fraction of this energy release is retained by the 
diss
wafer thus contributing to the temperature increase.   
 
The contribution of each type of heat flux, q , q , and q , is included in the thermal 
ions cond rec
model.  Because radially-resolved experimental values for the flux of ions, metastables, and 
neutrals to the wafer surface and values for the neutral temperature above the wafer surface 
cannot be readily measured, they are obtained from an ICP chamber model.  The ICP model 
simulation is adjusted (through the applied source power) until the simulation wall ion current is 
equivalent to the experimentally measured ion current, thus normalizing experiment to model.  
This allows for extrapolation of the experimental data from the position of the Langmuir probe 
above the surface down to the wafer surface (cf Chapter 3, section 3.2.3).  This model has been 
described in detail by Hsu48 and has been found to accurately simulate the ICP reactor chamber. 
Appendix  C  contains  the  ICP  numerical  model  and  describes  the  modifications  made  for 
generation of Ar-metastable (Arm) species. 
  
The heat flux expressions for the Ar and Ar/O  ion contributions, and the q  and q

4.5   Results & Discussion 
 
The PlasmaTempTM sensor wafer was exposed to a pure Ar and Ar/O  mix plasma under the 
2
conditions listed in Table 4.1 and 4.2.  These conditions enabled rapid and stable plasma ignition 
so that the initial temperature rise could be studied without transients due to power adjustments. 
Furthermore, recall that experiments were conducted without chuck bias so that wafer heating 
effects are not dominated by kinetic energy transfer from bombarding ions alone and other 
heating effects could be observed. Pure Ar conditions were first examined to ensure that other 
heating mechanisms, such as Arm and thermal heat conduction did not play a major role. This 
was followed by an examination of heating mechanisms for Ar/O  plasmas focusing on heating 
2
contribution from thermal heat conduction and O-atom recombination. 
 
 
4.5.1   Wafer Heating Mechanisms in Ar Plasmas 
 
In the previous PlasmaTempTM study33, wafer heating in inert, atomic plasmas, such as Ar, were 
attributed  to  kinetic  energy  transfer  due  to  ion  bombardment  (nu eΦ )  and  ion-electron 
i b P
recombination  (nu eε ).  Although  additional  heating  mechanisms  such  as  presheath  energy 
i b iz
transfer (0.5nu eT ), electron thermal energy transfer (2nu eT ) and Ar-metastable quenching 
i b e i b e
(0.25n ν ε*) are insignificant factors, the terms were included in the 3D model study for 
Ar,m Ar
completion.  Figure 4.3 demonstrates good agreement between experimental and simulation 
results that includes the additional heating terms for 90 mT 70 W, 0.55 mA/m2 and 130 W, 1.57 
mA/cm2 cases. For low powers (i.e. low ion fluxes) the model tends to slightly underestimate the 
temperature rise since the model-predicted plasma density is more underestimated at lower 
powers.  Examination of the time evolution of ∂T/∂t demonstrates that the model well predicts 
the rate of wafer temperature increase (Figure 4.4).   
 
The fraction of heat transfer from ion bombarding energy, ion/electron recombination, 
electron thermal energy, Arm and presheath energy are ~32 %, ~51 %, ~13 %, ~0.8 %, and ~3 %, 
respectively (see Appendix A). Other heating mechanisms such as photon irradiation contributed 
to ~ 0.25 % of the total heat flux and were considered negligible. The modeled total heat flux to 
the wafer surface scales linearly with the experimental ion current (Figure 4.5). Note, the Ar+ and 
Arm fluxes were determined from the ICP model as described in the section 4.4.

2
generating a plasma with ion currents similar to that generated in Ar plasmas. Figure 4.6 displays 
results obtained with the PlasmaTempTM sensor wafer at different radial positions (r = 0 cm to r 
= 6.47 cm). A 70 mT Ar discharge with a total ion current of 0.48 mA/cm2 is compared to a 70 
mT Ar/O  discharge with a similar ion current of 0.45 mA/cm2.

A similar total ion current in an Ar and Ar/O  discharge should yield a nearly identical 
2
temperature rise if wafer heating can be solely attributed to kinetic energy transfer from ion 
bombardment and ion-electron recombination. However, it was observed under nearly identical 
total ion fluxes that the temperature rise for the Ar/O  plasma is two times greater.  The larger 
2
temperature rise suggests additional heating mechanisms arise in molecular gas plasmas. In other 
experiments (Figure 4.7), PlasmaTempTM measurements show that for a 30 s exposure to an Ar 
discharge having an ion flux ~1.6 times greater than the Ar/O  discharge, the wafer temperature 
2
is ~30 degrees lower than the wafer exposed to the Ar/O  plasma. Therefore, even in conditions 
2
where the ion current is far smaller in the Ar/O  discharge (i.e. less kinetic energy transfer due to 
2
ion bombardment) there is a significant amount of heating that must be attributed to another 
source. 
 
In previous studies by C.C. Hsu et al.33 and as demonstrated in section 4.5.1, modeling 
showed that the PlasmaTempTM temperature rise for a pure Ar plasma was due to the sum of ion 
bombardment, ion-electron recombination, electron thermal energy, Arm quenching, and pre-
sheath ion energy.  If the wafer response for an Ar/O  discharge is similarly modeled with 
2
respect to an Ar discharge, i.e. exclude the q  and q  terms and only consider heat transfer 
cond rec
due to the flux of O +, O+ and Ar+ and their respective ion-electron recombination reactions, then 
2
a significant under-prediction of the temperature rise results. Figure 4.8 shows a comparison 
between experimental and modeling results for a 90 mT Ar/O  plasma with an ion flux of 1.64 
2
mA/cm2.  Here, the model accounts for heating due only to ion bombardment and ion-electron 
recombination.  Simulation results show a temperature rise 32 degrees less than the experimental 
temperature rise after a 35 s exposure to the plasma. When the evolution of the time derivative of 
the temperature, ∂T/∂t vs. t (Figure 4.9) is examined, it is found that within the first three 
seconds of plasma exposure, the simulation predicts a rate of temperature rise 2.4 times smaller 
than in the experiment. The model is therefore missing some heating terms. For the Ar/O  
2
discharge at these conditions, kinetic energy transfer from ion bombardment and ion-electron 
recombination contributes to only 45 % of the total wafer heating.

Better agreement is achieved when q  and q  terms are included in the model (Figure 
cond rec
4.10).  Plot 4.10 displays near-quantitative agreement between the experimental and model 
temperature rise (at r = 0 cm and r = 5.48 cm), showing that q  from the neutral gas and O-
cond
atom recombination on the wafer surface can account for the remaining 55 % of wafer heating. 
Under these conditions a γ  of 0.02 was used and contributed 15 % of total wafer heating. The 
rec
neutral gas temperature above the wafer surface originally predicted from the ICP model was 
500 K at r = 0 cm. The uncertainties in the plasma model are such that this value is only an 
estimate. Therefore the temperature was increased by 10 % to improve agreement between the 
   
45
wafer  thermal  model  and  the  experimental  results.  The  same  trend  is  obtained  for  other 
experimental conditions as well, although not shown here. 
 
It is important to note that distinguishing the heat contribution due to either q  or q  
cond rec
individually is difficult. In this analysis, the O-atom surface recombination coefficient and the 
peak neutral gas temperature were treated as adjustable parameters in the model in order to 
match  measurements  and  model.    As  is  well  known  precise  values  of  γ   are  difficult  to 
rec
experimentally  measure  due  to  various  complicating  factors  such  as  coupling  with  ion 
bombardment, among other effects82. A typical value reported for γ  for O atoms on insulating 
rec
materials is 0.0183. For this study, a value of 0.02 for γ  was chosen as an approximate value 
rec
and fixed for all modeling conditions. Similarly, plasma neutral gas temperatures are difficult to 
experimentally measure or model, with precision. Bulk plasma temperatures can be measured 
through optical emission spectroscopy (OES)28. The neutral gas temperature, or translational 
temperature, can be estimated by observing the rotational energy of a diatomic species, such as 
N , that has been introduced into the gas flow. The rotational energy mode is generally assumed 
2
to be in thermal equilibrium with the translational energy mode due to efficient kinetic energy 
transfer during collisions28. Measurements with OES, however, are line of sight averages that 
yield rotational temperatures that may be only within ± 200 K of the actual peak neutral gas 
temperature28. Even if accurate (± 1~10 K) experimental measurements for the bulk temperature 
could be utilized to determine the accuracy of the ICP model’s temperature predictions, there is 
still the matter of determining the gas temperature above the wafer surface. For the purposes of 
the present study, the ICP model-predicted gas temperature above the wafer surface was used as 
a first estimate of T  and was accordingly increased or decreased (± 10 %) to achieve the best fit 
g
to the measured temperature vs. time data.

2
experiments. The percent contributions are based on only the seven mechanisms studied in the 
heat flux calculations. Under these conditions, heating from Arm quenching is less than 1 % and 
is in agreement with other studies64,77. Therefore, heating due to Arm quenching is considered 
negligible in comparison to other heat sources. q , however, does play a significant role in 
cond
wafer heating (up to 50 % under certain processing conditions).

Heating and cooling mechanisms, such as radiation, may also play an important role in 
wafer temperature response, although they weren’t included in this study. For the investigated 
conditions a heat flux generated by photon radiation was ~ 2 – 5 W/m2, which is less than 0.25 % 
of the total heat flux and was determined to be negligible64,84,85. Also, calculations showed that 
for these short time (~ < 60 s) experiments where maximum temperature rises varied between 10 
~ 70 K above room temperature depending on the processing conditions, radiative cooling was 
negligible.  Other heat sources such as energy released due to combustion of polyimide on the 
wafer surface were also not included. Energies released by dissociating CO bonds would release 
~ 7 – 11 eV to the wafer surface85. This heat release would significantly increase the wafer 
temperature rise, which was not observed in experimental results. This could be validated by 
testing with a uniform polyimide or polysilicon coating on the sensor wafer, which was not done 
in this study. Lastly, other effects such as fast neutrals were eliminated since the sheaths are 
nearly collisionless for the investigated conditions. 
 
 
4.5.3   Wafer Cooling Mechanisms 
 
Heat transfer to, from, and within the wafer is best captured with a 3D model that considers the 
thermal effects of the electronic module. The electronic module is a 3.6 mm thick device with a 
relatively large heat capacity value (820 J kg-1 K-1) that acts as a heat sink during wafer heating, 
or a heat source during wafer cooling (Figure 4.11 – 4.12). Wafer cooling trends were captured 
with the PlasmaTempTM by monitoring the wafer after being exposed to a plasma for ~30 
seconds.

and assuming the wafer is a composite material consisting of Si and polyimide coating, yields a 
value for τ  of 67 seconds. τ  is almost five times larger than τ  and can be shown to be due to the

thermal inertia of the electronic module which acts as a significant heat sink or source, affecting 
the transient thermal behavior of the wafer. This effect can be readily observed in temperature 
contour plots of the wafer surface as illustrated in Figure 4.14 (also Figure 4.11 and 4.12), and 
yields significant insight into the effects of sensor wafer design. Note, that convective heat 
transfer must be considered if neutral gas flow is not turned off after the plasma is extinguished.

4.6   Conclusion 
 
Wafer heating mechanisms in an Ar/O  ICP were investigated by combining in-situ, real time 
2
temperature measurements from the PlasmaTempTM sensor wafer with a 3D heat transfer model 
of the wafer. Comparisons between pure Ar and Ar/O  discharges demonstrated that heating 
2
from the gas phase and O-atom recombination can be important in molecular gas plasmas. These 
mechanisms were shown to contribute as much as 70 % to wafer heating under conditions of low 
bias power.  This study demonstrated how the “on-wafer” temperature sensor not only yields a 
temperature profile distribution across the wafer, but can be used to help determine plasma 
characteristics, such as ion flux profiles or plasma processing temperatures. The 3D model also 
successfully captured the thermal behavior of each domain and accounted for the 3D temperature 
distortion that arose due to the heat capacity of the electronic module.  This result gives insight 
into the role of sensor wafer design on performance under transient conditions.

Chapter 5 – “On-Wafer” Voltage Sensor Analysis in 
an Inductively Coupled Plasma 
 
 
 
5.1   Abstract 
 
This chapter presents a second study on a novel, “on-wafer” sensor, the PlasmaVoltTM. The 
commercially manufactured PlasmaVoltTM sensor wafer was studied in the inductively coupled 
plasma reactor in an effort to validate sensor measurements. A pure Ar plasma at various powers 
(25 – 420 W), for a range of pressures (10 – 80 mT) and bias voltages (0 – 250 V) was utilized. 
A numerical sheath simulation was simultaneously developed in order to interpret experimental 
results. It was found that PlasmaVoltTM sensor measurements are proportional to the RF-current 
through the sheath.  Under conditions such that the sheath impedance is dominantly capacitive, 
sensor measurements follow a scaling law derived from the inhomogeneous sheath model of 
Lieberman2. Under these conditions, sensor measurements are proportional to the square root of 
plasma density at the plasma-sheath interface, one-fourth root of the electron temperature, and 
one-fourth  root  of  the  RF-bias  voltage.  When  the  sheath  impedance  becomes  increasingly 
resistive,  the  sensor  measurements  deviate  from  the  scaling  law  and  tend  to  be  directly 
proportional  to  the  plasma  density.  The  measurements  and  numerical  sheath  simulation 
demonstrate the scaling behavior as a function of changing sheath impedance for various plasma 
conditions.  
 
 
5.2   Introduction 
 
The semiconductor industry’s need for continuous improvement of feature and chip scaling 
requires stringent process control and a thorough understanding of the dynamic relationships 
between process control variables and plasma characteristics.  Therefore, plasma and wafer 
diagnostics that couple processing control parameters to plasma and wafer characteristics are 
essential tools that will bring an understanding of how chip features evolve as a function of 
50
processing conditions.  Traditional plasma diagnostic tools are typically in-situ or in-line and are 
typically attached to the plasma etch tool.  These devices may be present in the load/lock 
chamber for pre or post processing measurements or mounted on the reactor wall.  In-line 
sensors are categorized as either “wafer state” or “process state” sensors22.  A process state 
sensor monitors the process, i.e. they may detect gas phase reactants and product species, and 
bulk  temperatures  and  densities,  with  residual  gas  analyzers  (RGA),  optical  emission 
spectrometers  (OES)  or  Langmuir  probes,  respectively25-28.    A  wafer  state  sensor  monitors 
changes directly observed on the wafer surface, such as etch rates or film thickness. Examples of 
such sensors include but are not limited to reflectometers, ellipsometers, and scatterometers16,21,23. 
 
These diagnostic tools aren’t without merit, but they do have drawbacks especially in 
commercial applications. In-line and in-situ metrology typically measure bulk parameters such as 
plasma temperature, density and species type. The metrology may also be limited to monitoring 
single-locations  on  a  wafer  thus  yielding  average  thickness  values  or  etching  rates.  These 
monitoring tools may not directly take into account the spatial variation in etching rate or film 
thickness across the wafer, which is important when dealing with wafers 300 mm in diameter17. 
Furthermore, in-line metrology often requires modification of commercial tools to accommodate 
the installation of monitoring devices, thus increasing the cost and complexity of integrating 
sensors onto the equipment. 
 
New  metrology  tools  that  are  capable  of  providing  spatially-resolved  wafer-state 
information are called “SensArrayTM” or “on-wafer” sensors. These are wafers with sensors 
embedded onto the wafer surface, capable of measuring parameters such as wafer temperature at 
different radial positions. These sensor wafers are entered into production flow with standard 
product wafers and act as autonomous measuring devices capable of capturing the temporal 
evolution of wafer processing states in real time. Real time, in-situ measurements at the wafer 
level improves diagnostic capabilities without requiring integration of additional equipment to 
the  plasma  etching  tools,  saving  both  time  and  operational  expenses19,24.    Furthermore, 
establishing the temporal and spatial evolution of wafer-surface or plasma characteristics will 
allow for more finely tuned control of the processing equipment. This will be necessary as 
feature  dimensions  continue  to  grow  smaller  and  demands  for  robust  sensors  and  process 
controllers  increase.  For  plasma  etch,  process  objectives  include  critical  dimension  control, 
minimizing damage and contamination, and increasing uniformity and selectivity. “On-wafer” 
sensors in plasma processes have the potential to enhance process control by providing important 
information about the plasma at the wafer location.  
 
One commercially available “on-wafer” sensor system is PlasmaVoltTM, manufactured by 
KLA-Tencor. PlasmaVoltTM records spatially resolved, real-time, and in-situ measurements of 
RF-current at the wafer surface.  These measurements have the potential to yield information on 
the physical interaction between the plasma, sheath, and wafer surfaces at any time and location, 
which would allow for better process control capabilities. For example, in an inductively coupled 
plasma (ICP) etch tool, an important feature is the capability to separately control the bias 
voltage or power of the wafer electrode and the source power.  Bias voltage controls the energy 
of ions impacting the wafer and source power controls the ion flux2. Control over the ion flux 
and ion bombarding energies at the wafer surface are important because they help determine the 
etch rates, etch selectivities and profile evolution of features. Many studies have utilized in-situ 
51
diagnostic tools, such as gridded ion energy or retarding field ion energy analyzers, to measure 
the  ion  energy  distribution  (IED)  profiles  over  a  wafer  surface86-88  or  Langmuir  probes  to 
measure plasma densities over the wafer surface38. These experimental studies are often limited 
to single location analyses within the chamber and generally require modification of the etch tool. 
If an “on-wafer” wafer like the PlasmaVoltTM could be utilized to take measurements that were 
related  to  a  plasma  characteristic  such  as  density,  PlasmaVoltTM  would  allow  for  spatially 
resolved, real-time measurements without disturbing the plasma environment or requiring tool 
modification.  
 
Because sensor wafers like PlasmaVoltTM are still relatively new, information about the 
relationship  between  the  sensor  measurements  and  the  plasma  characteristics  are  limited.  
Therefore the objective of this study is to establish a more quantitative understanding of the 
relationship between the PlasmaVoltTM sensor measurements and the plasma characteristics. This 
was done by combining measurements of the plasma with a sheath model and comparing the 
results to the sensor measurements. The plasma density, electron average energy, and ion flux to 
the wall were measured in an ICP tool under a variety of conditions. In addition, the voltage 
waveform applied to the wafer-bearing electrode was measured as well. The sheath models relate 
plasma characteristics such as plasma density and electron temperature to RF-voltage and current 
at  the  electrode.  The  combined  plasma  diagnostics  and  models  are  then  related  to  sensor 
measurements. 
 
 
5.3   Experimental Methods 
 
5.3.1   Experimental Apparatus & Diagnostic Tools 
 
The PlasmaVoltTM sensor wafer was tested in a university built ICP etch system that has been 
described in Chapter 2. Briefly, the ICP reactor consists of a cylindrical, stainless steel chamber, 
20 cm in diameter and 10 cm in height. A five-turn planar coil delivers 13.56 MHz radio 
frequency (RF) power through the alumina dielectric window at the chamber top. A Faraday 
shield placed between the coil and the dielectric plate minimizes the capacitive coupling. The 
bias voltage is delivered through a second 13.56 MHz power source through the stainless steel 
electrode (chuck) at the chamber bottom.  The bias voltage applied to the chuck is measured with 
a  high  voltage  probe  connected  directly  to  the  chuck  and  is  recorded  with  a  TDS  2022B 
Tektronix oscilloscope. The bias power is a few watts (10 – 30 W), therefore minimizing the 
capacitive coupling between the chuck and plasma. The measured peak-to-peak bias voltage is 
approximately twice the DC-bias voltage. 
 
The ICP chamber is also equipped with several diagnostic tools, including a Langmuir 
probe, a wall-mounted ion current probe, and an optical emission spectrometer (OES). All 
experimental sampling ports are located 2.54 cm above the chuck.  The Langmuir probe is 
designed according to the guidelines of Godyak et al.27,38. The probe is introduced into the 
plasma chamber through a differentially pumped radial motion feed-through and can access 
different radial positions ranging from r = 0 cm to r = 7.5 cm. The probe is used to measure the 
electron  temperature  (T ),  electron  density  (n )  radial  profiles  and  the  sheath  potential  by 
e e
measurement of the electron energy probability function (EEPF) and application of the second 
52
derivative method27,38.    The  electron  temperature  is  defined  as  2/3  of  the  average  electron 
energy2.  The ion current probe is a circular, 0.4 cm2 wall-mounted planar probe DC biased to – 
40 V. A 2 mm wide guard ring surrounding the probe and similarly biased to –40 V is used to 
suppress edge effects25. The probe is used to measure the total positive ion current to the 
chamber wall33.  The temporal evolution of the DC ion current is measured by an Agilent 
34410A 6½ Digit Multimeter, thus also establishing the relative plasma stability over time. The 
optical emission collected with an Ocean Optics PC2000-UV-VIS-ISA OES is used to monitor 
the plasma and ensure the plasma has reached steady-state soon after plasma ignition. The 
temporal evolution of the 811.5 nm Ar emission line is used to indicate plasma stability33.  
 
 
5.3.2   The “on-wafer” sensor: PlasmaVoltTM 
 
PlasmaVoltTM is a commercially available 200-300 mm diameter sensor wafer produced by 
KLA-Tencor. For the present experiments, a 150 mm diameter version of the wafer, modified 
with an electronic tether is utilized (Figure 5.1). The electronic tether is fed through a vacuum 
compatible electrical feed-through located in the ICP chamber wall and is attached to a DC 
power supply. The ICP chamber lacks a load-lock mechanism for rapid transfer of the wafer into 
and  out  of  the  chamber.  This  electronic  tether  modification  therefore  allows  consecutive 
experiments  to  be  carried  out  rapidly,  avoiding  the  time-consuming  process  of  repetitively 
opening and closing the chamber.

53
The sensor wafer contains two RF-current sensors located at 5 mm and 66 mm away 
from the wafer center and is protected with a layer of Kapton tape. The sensors consist of thin 
film, copper capacitors connected to RF-diodes (Figure 5.2). The sensor diameter is 0.81 cm and 
the disk thickness is 0.0018 cm; the spacing between disks is 0.0025 cm. RF-current flowing 
along the wafer at the sensor location creates a DC voltage across the sensor capacitor. The 
sensor capacitor is ohmically isolated from the plasma and a decoupling capacitor between the 
sensor  capacitor  and  diode,  ensures  only  the  AC  measurement  is  transmitted.  Sensor 
measurements are proportional to the rectified and period-averaged RF peak voltage across the 
capacitor48. This measurement is subsequently referred to as 'V ,' or peak-to-peak voltage from 
rf
the  sensor.  The  wafer  is  equipped  with  an  electronic  module  that  allows  for  high  speed, 
autonomous data acquisition and wireless data transfer. Data is downloaded to a computer 
equipped with PlasmaViewTM, a software package.  
 
 
5.3.3   Experimental Conditions 
 
The PlasmaVoltTM sensor wafer was tested in the ICP chamber with an Ar plasma under a

5.4   Sheath Model Formulation 
 
A one-dimensional (1D) model of a sheath was developed in a numerical software package, 
COMSOLTM. A sketch of the domain is shown in Figure 5.3; the electrode is located at x = 0, 
and the total domain length (L) is adjusted from 5 to 10 mm depending on the biasing conditions, 
i.e. the length is adjusted to minimize solution convergence time. An initial length of 5 – 10 mm 
was chosen based on the analytical solution for the limiting case of the Child-Law sheath, 
54
discussed later.  The domain length is chosen to be slightly greater than the sheath so that the 
plasma-sheath boundary conditions of plasma density, plasma potential and ion velocity can be 
applied consistently. The plasma is assumed to consist of a single positive ion species and 
electrons in a static neutral background of argon. For simplicity, electron temperature is assumed 
to be constant through the sheath and secondary electron emission and electron impact ionization 
are neglected in the model. It is known that in Ar plasmas for pressures below 100 mT and 
driven at 13.56 MHz, secondary electrons are typically not important2. Spatial and temporal 
profiles of ion velocity (u), potential (Φ), and density (n, n ) are calculated by solving Poisson’s 
i i e
equation and the fluid equations for ion-continuity and ion-momentum.  Electrons are assumed to 
follow  a  Boltzmann  distribution.  The  present  model  is  intended  to  represent  an  RF-biased 
electrode in an inductively coupled plasma under conditions such that the plasma potential has 
little or no RF component. This is a good approximation in the experimental chamber utilized in 
this study.

solution to Poisson's equation.  
 
At x = L, the plasma potential is set as Φ = 0, consistent with the assumption of no RF 
component in the plasma potential. Positive ions are required to enter the sheath with at least the 
Bohm velocity2. Therefore the ion velocity at x = L (just outside the sheath) is set equal to the 
Bohm velocity. The Bohm velocity is defined as,

Equation 5.11 using the value of T  obtained from Langmuir probe measurements 2.54 cm above

5.5   Results & Discussion 
 
5.5.1   Sheath Model Validation 
 
The accuracy of the sheath model was tested in part by comparing results to experimental and 
numerical sheath model data produced by Sobolewski51.  Sobolewski created a 1D sheath model 
similar to the one described here, extending from the electrode to an arbitrary position into the 
plasma. The simulation predicts ion and electron density profiles by solving the ion continuity, 
ion momentum, and Poisson’s equations using the oscillating-step approximation for electrons, 
i.e. n  = n on the plasma side of the step (x < W(t)) and n  = 0 on the sheath side of the step (x > 
e i e
W(t)). W(t) is calculated as a part of the solution.  Sobolewski’s model applies the Bohm 
criterion (i.e. the ions are accelerated by the electric field (E = kT /2eλ ) to the Bohm velocity at 
e d
the sheath edge) to the electrode surface.  For consistency, the same BCs were applied for this 
study’s sheath model. Also, Sobolewski’s model uses the measured voltage across the sheath as 
an  input  parameter.  As  this  was  not  available  for  input  into  the  COMSOLTM  simulation, 
Sobolewski’s RF-current output (a nearly sinusoidal 0.8 A RF-current) was instead used as input. 
Sobolewski’s  model  and  the  present  simulation  showed  good  agreement  for  the  following 
condition, which was close to the conditions relevant for this study: 10 MHz driving frequency, 
120 W source power, 0.319 A ion current at the electrode, plasma/sheath electron density of 1.25 
× 10-11 cm-3, and an electron temperature of 3.0 eV.   Figure 5.4 from the present model is a plot 
of the sheath voltage and current components for this case, and it is in good agreement with the 
corresponding result in Figure 8 of Sobolewski51. 
 
It is noted that for a sinusoidal RF-current input, the resulting voltage drop across the 
sheath is highly non-sinusoidal and, as mentioned above, the waveform is similar to the sheath 
voltage measured by Sobolewski. During the cathodic phase of the cycle, electrons are repelled 
from the electrode surface and the corresponding electron current to the electrode is nearly zero. 
During this part of the cycle, the sum of the positive ion and displacement currents maintain the 
total current within the sheath. Note that inclusion of the time derivatives in the ion continuity 
and momentum equations allows the sheath model to capture transients in ion current and density 
through the period. 
 
The present sheath simulation was also validated by comparing it to the limiting case of a 
direct current (DC) Child’s Law analytical solution. In the Child Law DC sheath model, the 
electron density is assumed to be zero, and in this limit an analytical solution can be found for 
sheath thickness, s.

represents  the  analytical  solution  to  the  collisional  Child-Law  sheath.    It  is  clear  that  the 
collisional Child-Law sheath model and the collisional numerical sheath model are in reasonable 
agreement. The small differences are attributed to the fact that the numerical solution assumes 
Boltzmann-distributed electrons rather than zero electron density in the case of the Child's Law 
solution.  The analytical Child-law solution also provides a good initial estimate for the domain 
length of the numerical simulation.

5.5.2   Sheath Simulation Results 
 
The benefit of an inductively coupled plasma is the ability to independently control ion energy 
and plasma density. The deposition power controls plasma density while the bias power to the 
lower electrode controls the potential drop through the sheath, hence the ion energy2. The sheath 
simulation is useful in demonstrating the effects of bias voltages on plasma characteristics, such 
as electron density and current, through the sheath and onto the wafer surface for a range of 
operating pressures, powers, and frequencies.  Figure 5.6 demonstrate typical plasma potential, 
ion velocity, and ion/electron density profiles through a sheath for an applied bias voltage (in this 
case I ). As the RF-current amplitude (I ) is increased, the potential drop through the sheath 
rf rf
increases, generating a thicker sheath and causing a greater acceleration of ions toward the 
electrode.  Ions tend to follow the period averaged potential drop in these thick sheaths, while the 
instantaneous drop is followed for thinner sheaths. The respective I , I, and I  profiles, for 
d i e
reference are shown in Appendix B, and qualitatively agree well with the sheath simulation 
studies by Nitschke91.

The sheath thickness is dependent on both the bias voltage and plasma density and is 
derived from the simulation according to Equation 5.13.  Figure 5.7 clearly demonstrates that the 
sheath  thickness  increases  with  bias  voltage  while  simultaneously  the  increasingly  larger 
potential repels electrons from and accelerates ions toward the electrode (Figures 5.9 – 5.12).   In 
contrast, as the plasma density increases, the sheath thickness decreases (Figure 5.8).  This 
behavior agrees well with analytical solutions for sheath thicknesses (Equation 5.14) of low-
density plasmas and high voltage applications derived from Lieberman2:

Comparing the sheath thickness to the ion mean free path (λ) demonstrates the degree of 
i
sheath collisionality. For s < λ the sheath is collisionless, while s > λ indicates the sheath is 
i i
collisional. At low pressures, 10 mT, λ ~ 0.003 m and the sheath is considered collisionless 
i
throughout the entire RF-cycle (13.56 MHz), while at 20 mT, λ ~ 0.0015 m and the sheath is 
i
collisional for part of the RF-cycle.  As the pressure increases to 50 mT and 80 mT (λ ~ 0.0006 
i
m and 0.0004 m, respectively), the sheath is collisional for the entire RF-cycle. See Appendix B 
for plots. 
 
Much like the sheath thickness, the dynamic behavior of the displacement, electron, and 
ion currents also depend on bias voltage and plasma density. Figure 5.13 shows the behavior of 
Φ , I , I, and I  at the electrode surface, biased to 200 V, for a low density (35 W) and high 
P d i e
density (420 W) plasma.  At low plasma densities the potential is nearly sinusoidal and I  is the 
d
primary current in the sheath while I  and I can be considered negligible. As the plasma density 
e i
increases, however, the potential grows increasingly non-sinusoidal and I  and I become a 
e i
significant fraction of the total current and begins to affect the sheath impedance (Figure 5.14).

5.5.3   Validating PlasmaVoltTM Measurements 
 
PlasmaVoltTM sensor measurements (V ) as a function of the measured applied RF peak-to-peak 
rf
bias voltage magnitude (V ) are plotted (Figure 5.15) for two of the plasma conditions 
pp,bias
investigated (10 mT at 50 W and 400 W ICP power). Figure 5.15 shows that V  increases non-
rf
linearly with increasing V  for each ICP condition.  Note, V  is measured closest to the 
pp,bias pp,bias
chuck as possible (minimizing circuit length) and half the V   amplitude is approximately the 
pp,bias
DC-bias voltage. The difference between the center sensor measurement (solid points) and edge 
sensor measurement (hollow points) is attributed to the radial variation of the electron density at 
the plasma/sheath interface (n ). As the pressure increases, the radial gradient of the density 
es
increases because the plasma transport processes becomes collisionally dominant. This produces 
a larger difference between center and edge density values and is reflected by the increasing 
difference between center and edge V  measurements.  In the 10 mT case demonstrated in Figure 
rf
5.15, there is a center-to-edge average difference in n  of 27 %. For a higher pressure, 50 mT, 
es
case  (Figure  5.16)  the  average  center-to-edge  difference  is  54  %.    A  more  quantitative 
assessment of this effect requires interpretation with the sheath model as will be discussed later. 
 
The numerical sheath simulation was utilized to test whether sensor measurements were 
proportional to the RF-current density. The simulation was run for the various ICP conditions, 
where input parameters n  and T  were obtained from experimental measurements.  I  was 
es e rf
changed until the simulated peak-to-peak bias voltage at the electrode (V ) matched the 
pp,bias
experimental peak-to-peak bias voltages obtained with the oscilloscope (see Appendix B, section 
B.4). If V  is proportional to I  then a plot of I  vs. V  should resemble Figures 5.15 – 5.16.

In fact, when plotting I  vs. V  and V  vs. V (Figure 5.17), a one-to-one correspondence

is observed, i.e. the superimposed experimental and simulation data points demonstrate that I  is

5.5.4   Correlating PlasmaVoltTM Measurements to Plasma Density 
 
Another goal of the study was to develop a quantitative model of the sensor response in terms of 
plasma quantities such as n  and T . Since it is established that V is proportional to I , the next 
e e rf   rf
objective is to find a plasma sheath model that can relate how I depends on plasma parameters. 
rf  
First an analytical sheath model is sought to apply to experimental measurements to obtain 
relevant scaling laws, if they can be found for the conditions chosen. Then the numerical sheath 
model is used to check that the analytical model can be applied to the conditions chosen. Finally, 
the numerical sheath model can be used to suggest plasma sheath conditions for which the 
analytical model will no longer suffice. 
 
First the analytical inhomogeneous sheath model developed by Lieberman et al.2 is tested. 
This model should be valid if the following conditions hold:  
 
(1)  The magnitude of the RF displacement current (Ĩ ) dominates over the conduction 
disp
current. 
 
(2)  Ion density does not modulate through the RF period, implying ω2 >> ω 2, where ω  is  
pi pi
the ion plasma frequency.   
 
(3)  The electrons respond rapidly to the RF-potential, implying ω2 << ω 2,  where ω  is 
pe pe
the electron plasma frequency.   
 
(4)  The electron density in the sheath is zero, implying T  << V  (DC voltage across the 
e dc
sheath) and the electron Debye length is less than the sheath thickness (λ  << s).   
De
64
(5)  No electron-neutral inelastic collisions occur within the sheath, such as ionization.   
 
(6)  A sinusoidal RF-current passes through the sheath.   
 
(7)  No transverse variation exists along the electrodes, i.e. 1-dimensional treatment is valid.   
 
  To ensure the validity of these conditions during the experiments, a high voltage to the 
chuck is applied, such that T  << V  and λ  << s, where V  is ½ V . The RF-bias power is 
e dc De dc pp,bias
relatively low, ~10 – 20 W, thus minimizing the capacitive coupling with the plasma The plasma 
potential is therefore approximated as constant.  Even at low ICP powers, the ion transit time is 
several RF cycles, therefore the ions traverse the sheath with an average potential. In addition, 
although there is spatial variation in the plasma density across the chuck (as measured with the 
Langmuir probe), the sheath variation from center to edge is neglected for simplicity. It is later 
demonstrated that this is a reasonable assumption. 
 
With these assumptions the following relationship was derived2:

disp 0 es e pp,bias
 
Note, due to assumption (6) where a sinusoidal RF-current is assumed, self consistent equations 
can be derived to quantitatively determine the average ion sheath current and voltage expressions 
needed for Equation 5.15. Thus the constant plasma potential approach taken in the sheath model 
is also consistent with this derivation. This equation states that the square of Ĩ  is proportional 
disp
to n  and the square roots of T  and V . Given the previous result that V  is proportional to 
es e pp,bias rf
Ĩ , Equation 5.15 becomes

this relationship is valid for the ICP conditions investigated.   
 
The application of this model requires values for electron density at the plasma-sheath 
interface (n ) and a bulk T  The Langmuir probe that is available to measure n  and T  is taken 
es e. e e

e
accomplished by using a numerical model of the ICP chamber that gives fully resolved, spatial 
profiles of specie densities, velocities, and temperatures (cf Chapter 3, section 3.2.3). The ICP 
model has been described in detail previously48 and has been used for similar purposes33.  The 
ICP simulation is run under the experimental conditions observed and the resulting spatial 
scaling is applied to the experimental Langmuir probe data to determine n .  Note there is a 
es
center-to-edge variation in the electron energy distribution function measurement and this is 
reflected in n  measurements at the chamber center and edge (cf Table 5.1).  The measured T  
e e
values indicate there is very little spatial variation (< 10 %) (see Appendix B, Table B.1).  In 
addition, the OES and ion current data used to monitor plasma stability does not significantly 
drift or change during bias-voltage applications (cf Chapter 3, sections 3.3 and 3.5). Therefore, 
65
the plasma is assumed stable even when bias voltages are applied and that n  and T  are not 
e e
affected by the applied bias voltage.  
 
The proposed model scaling law from the inhomogeneous sheath model (Equation 5.16) 
is tested in Figure 5.18, using the PlasmaVoltTM sensor data and the scaled Langmuir probe data. 
The scaling law is demonstrated with three of the 10 mT plasma conditions. As can be seen, the 
data appear to follow the proposed scaling for the low density, 50 W and 100 W cases.  The 
deviation in the 10 mT, 400 W case is attributed to the increasingly resistive nature of the sheath 
impedance and will be discussed in detail later. Note that when the appropriate edge and center 
n  values are utilized in the scaling, the respective data points nearly collapse to a single line for 
es
both the 10 mT, 50 W and 100 W plasma conditions. With the scaling law, the center-to-edge 
data points now demonstrate only a 1 % (previously 27 %) difference for the 10 mT cases and a 
7 % (previously 54 %) difference for the higher pressure, 50 mT cases (Figure 5.19).  The 
superimposed  center  and  edge  data  points  show  that  the  scaling  law  derived  from  the 
inhomogeneous sheath model accurately describes the relationship between the square-root of 
the  electron  density  (accounting  for  spatial  variation  across  the  wafer)  and  V   sensor 
rf
measurement. In addition, this demonstrates that assumption (7) is valid in that there is no 
significant transverse variation across the plates, allowing only for differences in n  values.  
es
 
Although not shown here, a similar linear result is obtained when Equation 5.16 is 
applied to the simulation data, i.e. plotting (V )1/4 vs.  I / (n 1/2 T 1/4).  For the low density 
pp,bias rf  es e
cases, the simulation data behaves linearly and I  scales to the square-root of n . However, for 
rf es
the same higher density cases, (i.e. 10 mT, 400 W of Figure 5.18) the simulation data also does 
not follow the scaling derived from the inhomogeneous sheath model. As with the experimental 
case,  this  difference  is  attributed  to  the  changing  nature  of  the  sheath  impedance.  The 
assumptions used to derive the scaling from the inhomogeneous sheath model stipulate that the 
sheath must be highly capacitive in nature. For the higher density cases where the scaling does 
not suffice to describe the relationship between measurement and plasma density, the sheath 
impedance is growing increasingly resistive in nature.

The sheath impedance is a function of the sheath thickness, which is dependent upon the 
electron density and the voltage drop through the sheath2 (cf section 5.5.2).  Lower density and 
higher voltage tend to increase sheath thickness.  Thicker sheaths result in following the period 
averaged potential drop and are highly capacitive. Higher density plasmas, at lower bias voltages, 
tend to develop thinner sheaths where the ions follow the instantaneous potential drop.  These 
sheaths  are  more  resistive  in  nature.    The  resistive  or  capacitive  nature  of  the  sheath  is 
determined by taking the ratio of the displacement to conduction currents (I  / I ) from the 
disp cond
numerical  sheath  simulation.  In  addition,  the  ratio  of  I   /  I   is  calculated  based  on 
disp cond
experimental measurements, where I  / I  ≈ ω / ω and ω is the ion plasma frequency.  
disp cond i i
Excellent agreement is found between experimental and simulation results for I  / I  (Figure 
disp cond
5.20)  For I  / I   >> 1 the sheath is capacitive in nature; conversely, for I  / I  << 1 the

sheath is resistive in nature2.  The calculated ratios of I  to I  from the simulation are plotted 
disp cond
as  a  function  of  the  bias  voltage  and  plasma-sheath  interface  density  (Figure  5.21).    This 
resulting figure obtained from the numerical sheath model demonstrates the plasma conditions 
(densities and bias voltages) for which the scaling law will no longer suffice.  
 
As a further test of the limits of validity of the scaling law, Figure 5.22 displays the 
simulated RF-current values (solid lines) plotted as a function of density (at the plasma/sheath 
interface) for electrode bias (V ) values ranging from 50 V – 200 V in a 10 mT Ar plasma. 
pp,bias
The  scaling  law  applied  from  the  inhomogeneous  sheath  model  (dashed  lines)  follows  the 
simulation results when the plasma density is relatively low and the applied voltage relatively 
high. Under these conditions, current through the sheath tends to be dominated by displacement 
current and is capacitive. However, as plasma density increases and/or sheath voltage decreases, 
the  sheath  thickness  decreases  and  conduction  current  becomes  more  important  relative  to 
displacement  current.  Here,  the  sheath  model  scaling  no  longer  holds  and  the  RF-current 
becomes directly proportional to n .

RF-current is proportional to the square-root of plasma density. At higher densities with resistive sheaths the RF-
current is proportional to the plasma density. 
 
 
One unexpected result is the flexibility of the scaling law. First, the scaling law is 
applicable in the transition regime, where the sheath is neither fully capacitive nor resistive.  For 
many of the low density conditions investigated in Table 5.1, the sheath simulations show the 
experiments fall into the transition regime where Ĩ  is not dominant and a significant I  flows

through the sheath to the electrode. Surprisingly, the scaling of Ĩ  with V  and n  still holds 
disp pp,bias es
quite well.  The scaling may improve, i.e. different pressure (and thus density) conditions may 
superimpose if the sheath is entirely capacitive and Ĩ  >> I  and I.  This may explain why the 
disp e i
Ar  10  mT  and  50  mT  experimental  studies  did  not  collapse  to  the  same  line  during  the 
application of Equation 5.16.  
 
Secondly, the inhomogeneous sheath model’s scaling law performs well for both the 
collisionless and collisional sheath conditions. In this study, the 10 mT plasma condition is the 
only collisionless regime (λ >> s). For 20 – 80 mT conditions the sheaths become increasingly 
i
collisional. However, when the scaling law derived from the collisional inhomogeneous sheath 
model2 is applied to the PlasmaVoltTM data, the relationship between Ĩ  with V , and n  is 
disp pp,bias es
worse. This demonstrates that the collisionless inhomogeneous sheath model is fairly applicable 
to a wide range of processing conditions.  
 
 
5.5.5   Industry Relevant Applications 
 
In industry, it is often important to know the ion flux and sheath impedance behavior during 
wafer processing since it may have direct impact on the ion energy distribution, etching rates and 
ultimately profile evolution.  However, due to processing limitations, it may be impractical to 
measure the plasma densities and bias voltages. The experimental and simulation study with the 
68
PlasmaVoltTM sensor wafer demonstrates that the ion flux (plasma density) as well as resistive or 
capacitive behavior of the sheath can be predicted with this novel diagnostic tool and can be 
done so with minimal supplementary measurements.  Since n  scales with ICP deposition power 
e
(P ) and bias power (P ) scales with the ion current and bias voltage (J V ),  a plot of 
ICP bias ions pp,bias
V  / P 1/2 vs. P 1/4 should yield results similar to that in Figure 5.18.  With this substitution of 
rf ICP bias
easily measured variables (power) combined with the PlasmaVoltTM measurements, n  can be 
e
readily back-calculated, and the sheath processing regime determined.  
 
 
5.6   Summary & Concluding Remarks 
 
In  this  chapter,  it  was  demonstrated  that  PlasmaVoltTM  “on-wafer”  measurements  were 
proportional to the RF-current through the adjacent sheath at the wafer surface. A numerical 
simulation of an RF-sheath was developed and the simulated RF-bias voltage was matched to the 
experimental  results  by  adjusting  the  total  RF-current  density  boundary  condition.  By  this 
method the RF-current density was shown to be proportional to the sensor measurement. In order 
to correlate radial variations in sensor measurement to plasma characteristics, such as plasma 
density, a relation between RF-current and plasma characteristics was needed. A scaling law 
derived from Lieberman's inhomogeneous sheath model predicted that sensor measurements 
were proportional to n 1/2, T 1/4 and V 1/4 for capacitive sheath conditions.  The scaling law 
es e pp,bais
was shown to match experimental data and the RF sheath simulation reasonably well under 
conditions of lower plasma density and higher RF bias voltage.  For thinner, resistive sheaths 
typical  of  higher  density  and  lower  RF  bias  voltages,  the  scaling  derived  from  the 
inhomogeneous  sheath  model  was  no  longer  sufficient.  For  these  conditions,  the  sensor 
measurement was directly proportional to the plasma density. 
   
In order to improve the results, a more complex sheath model could be developed. 
Consideration of a 2D sheath model would better account for the center-to-edge variation of the 
plasma across the sheaths. In addition, other species such as the role of secondary electrons could 
be considered. Coupling the sheath model to a global plasma model would also allow for 
consideration of the effects of the electron energy distribution function at the plasma-sheath edge.

Chapter 6 – Absolute Vacuum Ultraviolet (VUV) 
Photon Flux in Inductively Coupled Plasmas and 
Chemical Modifications of 193nm Photoresist 
 
 
6.1   Abstract 
 
Vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photons in plasma processing systems are known to alter surface 
chemistry and may damage gate dielectrics and photoresist. In this chapter the absolute VUV 
photon fluxes to surfaces exposed in an argon inductively coupled plasma (1 mT – 50 mT, 25 W 
– 400 W) are characterized using a calibrated VUV spectrometer. In addition, an alternative 
method  to  estimate  VUV  fluence  in  an  inductively  coupled  plasma  (ICP)  reactor  using  a 
chemical dosimeter-type monitor is demonstrated. The technique is illustrated with argon ICP 
and xenon lamp exposure experiments, comparing direct VUV measurements with measured 
chemical changes in 193 nm photoresist-covered Si wafers following VUV exposure. A practical 
application is demonstrated by characterizing an atmospheric dielectric barrier discharge.  
 
 
6.2   Introduction 
 
Low  temperature  plasmas  create  vacuum  ultraviolet  (VUV)  photons,  primarily  via  electron 
impact excitation of neutral atoms and molecules. These photons may be re-absorbed, re-emitted, 
quenched, or interact with surfaces. At low pressures, < 50 mT, VUV photon fluxes to substrates 
exposed to the plasma may be considerable, potentially affecting surface chemical processes and 
material properties. Thus, understanding the effects of VUV emissions in plasma processing for 
semiconductor device manufacturing is becoming increasingly important, especially as critical 
dimensions shrink to nanometer scale and process control requirements grow more stringent.  
   
VUV photons are known in some cases to alter electrical properties of dielectrics and 
morphology of polymers.  Charge buildup and gate dielectric breakdown have been attributed to 
plasma-generated  VUV  exposure67,68,74.  Roughening  studies  of  polymethyl  methacrylate 
70
(PMMA)-based 193 nm photoresist (PR) have also addressed the effects of VUV exposure. 
Plasma pre-treatment with HBr or H -containing plasma have been reported to smooth PR line 
2
edge and line width roughness due to the VUV generated in the plasma8. Conversely, in other 
plasma-etching studies, the synergistic effects of simultaneous VUV exposure and energetic ion 
bombardment were shown to increase 193 nm PR roughening5,10.   
   
Current  techniques  utilized  to  measure  plasma-generated  VUV  emission  include 
chamber-mounted  VUV  spectrometers,  optical  emission  spectroscopic  interpretation  of  line 
intensity ratios35, and “on-wafer” monitoring by measurement of electron/hole pair generation in 
dielectric films68. While these techniques are proven successful, they generally require special 
sensors,  modification  of  equipment,  or  a  priori  knowledge  of  plasma  kinetics  (e.g.  specie 
energies, cross-sections, and escape factors).  
   
In this study, the VUV spectrum and plasma characteristics of an Ar ICP are examined 
with standard diagnostic tools.  An alternative method is proposed for estimating the VUV flux 
to substrate surfaces by monitoring the chemical changes of 193 nm PR induced by VUV 
exposure. It is shown that the changes in chemical composition in the film are a function only of 
photon  fluence  (or  dose).  This  approach  uses  standard  Si  wafers  and  commonly  available 
materials and instruments.  The method is illustrated in an Ar ICP chamber with comparisons 
made to Xe resonant lamp exposure under high vacuum conditions. A practical application is 
also demonstrated by characterizing the VUV emissions of an atmospheric dielectric barrier 
discharge (DBD) used in bio-medical applications. 
 
 
6.3   Experimental Setup  
 
6.3.1   Inductively Coupled Plasma System   
 
An Ar plasma is generated in the ICP system described in Chapter 2. The diagnostic tools used in 
this  study  will  be  briefly  discussed.  The  VUV  spectrum  is  measured  using  a  calibrated 
Resonance LTD VSFS92 VUV spectrometer.  Reported observations of VUV emitted from pure 
Ar plasmas focus on the intensities of the dominant 104.8 nm and 106.7 nm resonance lines66-68. 
In some experiments, a MgF  window was mounted between the VUV spectrometer to filter 
2
wavelengths < 112 nm92. The VUV spectrometer was mounted facing the load-locked sampling 
port through which the PR samples were exposed to the plasma, and should therefore experience 
the same VUV flux as the samples.  The positive ion current to the chamber wall is measured 
with a 0.4 cm2 wall-mounted planar probe DC biased to –40 V and surrounded by a 2 mm wide 
guard ring, also biased to –40 V to suppress edge effects33. The temporal evolution of the DC ion 
current is measured with an Agilent 34410A 6½ Digit Multimeter.  A Langmuir probe measures 
the electron temperature, electron density (n ) and sheath potential (Ф ) and an optical emission 
e p
spectrometer (Ocean Optics PC2000-UV-vis-ISA) monitors the plasma to ensure steady-state 
after plasma ignition.  
 
  193 nm PR samples were cleaved from a Si wafer spin-coated with 250-300 nm thick PR 
film (commercial 193 nm PMMA-based; Rohm & Haas). ~1 cm2 pieces were mounted on the 
radial-motion, linear feed-through stage and exposed to the plasma via the load-lock sidewall 
71
port of the ICP chamber. The sample was placed flush with the reactor wall and was electrically 
floating. The sample received a flux of VUV photons and low energy ions (no bias) generated in 
a 1 – 50 mT, 25 – 400 W Ar plasma, for short times (sample temperature ~25 – 60 °C). Table 6.1 
lists the experimental conditions investigated.

6.3.2   Ultra-high Vacuum Beam System   
 
To examine VUV-only effects on 193 nm PR, complementary experiments were conducted in a 
vacuum beam system, described in the dissertation of Dustin Nest62. The vacuum beam system 
allows for study of plasma-specific components (e.g. ions or VUV photons) and their effects on 
semiconductor materials.  In this set-up a 1 cm2 piece of PR-coated Si wafer was mounted on a 
translational-rotational, temperature controlled holder, and was exposed to a Resonance Xe lamp 
VUV emission line source (147 nm) with a calibrated flux of ~1.9 × 1014 photons/cm2/s. The 
VUV flux was held constant while the exposure time was varied (30 s – 1 hr), i.e. PR exposures 
were a function of VUV fluence only.  The vacuum beam system pressure is maintained below 
10-5 Torr ensuring rapid removal of any products.     
 
 
6.3.3   193 nm Photoresist Characterization 
 
193 nm PR is a commercially available photoresist used in fabrication of devices with sub-0.13 
μm features3.  It is a terpolymer consisting of methyl adamantyl methacrylate (MAMA) in the 
leaving group, α-gamma butyrolactone methacrylate (α-GBLMA) in the lactone group, and R-
functionalized adamantyl methacrylate (RAMA) in the polar group for adhesion (Figure 6.1). 
Both  pristine  and  processed  samples  were  characterized  with  Fourier  transform  infrared 
spectroscopy (FTIR) (Digilab  FTS-3000) where the changes in the C=O peaks for the lactone 
(1796 cm-1) and ester functional groups (1720 cm-1 and 1738 cm-1), C–O–C peaks (1050 – 1350 
cm-1) and CH /CH  (2800 – 3100 cm-1) peaks were measured.

6.4   Results & Discussion 
 
6.4.1   VUV and Ion Flux Characterization 
 
In order to study the chemical modifications of 193 nm PR caused by VUV photons, the VUV 
spectra and flux generated in the ICP were first characterized by using the chamber-mounted 
VUV spectrometer. Figure 6.2 shows the VUV spectrum for a 110 W Ar plasma for a range of 
pressures. The two primary resonance peaks at 104.8 nm (1s ) and 106.7 nm (1s ) were identified 
2 4
and compare well to other published Ar plasma VUV spectra66-68. As discussed in Chapter 3, the 
VUV peak intensities increase as pressure increases from 1 mT to 10 mT due to increasing 
plasma densities that enhance 1s  and 1s  production from the ground state or other 1s levels69. 
2 4
As pressure increases to 20 mT and 50 mT, the peak intensities decrease, apparently due to 
radiation trapping and an increase in quenching. In addition, the 104.8 nm and 106.7 nm lines 
tend to merge as pressure increases, a result of the dominant Doppler line broadening mechanism 
for these investigated conditions64. Absorption and quenching in the gas-filled region between 
the VUV spectrometer and the plasma also increases at higher pressures67,69,73. The dominating 
intensity of the 106.7 nm peak is attributed to its smaller absorption coefficient, typically four 
times less than the 104.8 nm peak64. 
 
The total VUV flux as a function of ICP power is displayed in Figure 6.3 (solid points). 
These flux values are determined for line of sight measurements 2.54 cm above the electrode 
surface and directly opposite the load-lock sampling port. The measured VUV flux is ~1016 
photons/cm2/s and is in good agreement with the range of VUV fluxes reported by Woodworth et 
al. (~3 × 1016 cm-2 s-1) in GEC reference cell experiments74, and Piejak et al. (~1 × 1016 – 5 × 
1016 cm-2 s-1) in their ICP experiments64. The VUV flux increases with power since plasma 
density and therefore excitation rates, increase with power.

The total ion flux measurements to the chamber wall are also given in Figure 6.3 (hollow 
points). The resulting VUV to ion flux ratio ranges from ~ 0.1 – 0.7 for the conditions examined 
and generally decreases with power since ion flux scales linearly with power.  The exposed PR 
samples receive virtually the same low energy ion flux in the chemical dosimeter experiments. 
As shown next, the changes in chemical composition of the bulk 193 nm PR are due only to 
photon fluence and not to ion fluence. 
 
 
6.4.2   VUV Modification of 193 nm Photoresist 
 
193 nm PR samples were processed in the Ar ICP conditions listed in Table 6.1 and then 
analyzed with FTIR.  FTIR spectra of 193 nm PR typically shows a decrease in the C=O and C–
O–C peaks induced by UV/VUV exposure while little or no change is observed in the CH /CH  
2 3
regions, indicating no etching loss of the PR6,10,62. Additionally, as VUV exposure time increases, 
a larger decrease in the C=O and C-O-C peaks are observed.  The 193 nm PR samples processed 
in the Ar plasma with low energy ions (condition 14) demonstrate this effect (Figure 6.4).  
 
From the FTIR spectra, the total peak intensity changes of C=O species are quantified 
and plotted as a function of the measured VUV fluence. Figure 6.5 displays a plot of the changes 
in C=O peak for both the Ar plasma experiments (squares & stars) and Xe lamp experiments 
(triangles) investigated. Figure 6.5 demonstrates that the chemical change in 193 nm PR is a 
function only of VUV fluence to the sample surface. This was verified by comparing test 
conditions, 5 and 8, 7 and 11, and 10 and 13. Each condition represents a significantly different 
plasma case, with varying VUV fluxes and photon/ion ratios. Exposure times were adjusted to 
maintain the same photon fluence, and this yielded the same change in FTIR spectra, thus 
confirming the dependence on VUV fluence. Furthermore, as in case 14 (stars) where the VUV 
flux was held constant and exposure time adjusted (5 sec – 5 min), it is clearly demonstrated that 
that C=O loss is a function of VUV fluence only.

experiments of varying conditions (1–13) and times (14) (squares and stars). Lines are to guide the eyes. 
 
 
 
The qualitative interpretation of the chemical changes as a function of photon fluence is 
as follows. Just after plasma ignition, VUV photons penetrate the top few nanometers of the film 
and break C=O and C–O–C bonds, liberating mostly CO6,10,62. Subsequent photons are able to 
penetrate deeper into the film past the less absorbent C-C and C-H bonds that are remaining. 
Typically, the absorption signal saturates to about 70 % of its original value when the films are 
~300 nm thick. This is interpreted to mean that the VUV photons penetrate about 100 nm into 
the film before being absorbed.  When about the top 100 nm of the polymer has been denuded of 
oxygen-containing bonds, the remaining C-C and C-H bonds in this region are sufficient to 
absorb most of the incident photons, and the decrease in FTIR peaks representing the oxygen-
containing bonds saturates. 
75
 
  The difference between the Xe lamp and Ar plasma experiments are attributed to the 
difference in VUV wavelengths. Xe VUV emission at 147 nm vs. Ar VUV emissions at 104.8 
and 106.7 nm have different absorption cross-sections, resulting in differences in bond breaking 
and penetration depth72,93. 
 
 
6.4.3   Chemical Dosimeter Application   
 
The fact that the FTIR peaks for the C=O bonds decreased only as a function of VUV fluence 
suggests that this measurement can be utilized as a chemical dosimeter. Such a method has the 
advantage of simplicity and can be used with standard Si wafers and PR.  As a practical 
application the chemical changes to 193 nm PR was measured after irradiation with a handheld, 
atmospheric, dielectric barrier discharge (DBD). Such devices are gaining interest in the bio-
medical field as a portable and economical tool for sterilization and disinfection purposes. 
Performance studies have demonstrated the DBD to have bactericidal and fungicidal effects on E. 
coli and candida albicans, respectively94. A primary concern in the use of plasmas for medical 
treatments  however  lies  in  its  possible  damaging  effect  on  eukaryotic  cells.  Therefore, 
measurement of UV and VUV emissions from these devices are of critical importance. 
   
A schematic of the DBD prototype is shown in Figure 6.6. The plasma is generated 
between the grounded electrode and Teflon plate, separated by a distance, d, (1 – 8 mm) (Figure 
6.7). 193 nm PR samples were placed above the grounded electrode and suspended (~6 mm) 
over the generated plasma discharge for 10 s – 120 s. Changes to the FTIR spectra were 
measured to determine VUV flux emissions from the DBD.

Figure 6.8  FTIR spectra for the C=O lactone and ester region of 193 nm PR samples suspended ~ 6 mm over the

The FTIR spectra demonstrate immeasurable change to the C=O and C–O–C regions of 
the 193 nm PR samples indicating few VUV emissions are reaching the sample surface (Figure 
6.8). Although optical emission spectroscopy show N  UV/vis emissions were emitted from the 
2
discharge, VUV emissions are most likely re-absorbed in the atmosphere. Thus, the negligible 
change to 193 nm PR samples show VUV emissions from the prototype DBD are not an 
immediate concern for medical applications.  
 
Successful application in characterizing VUV fluxes from plasma discharges with 193 
nm PR, however, should undergo careful consideration.  As illustrated in Figure 6.5, the FTIR 
peak changes in a non-linear fashion and saturates with respect to VUV fluence. This limits the 
utility of the method, as described here. Furthermore, the differences between Ar and Xe VUV 
exposure show that any dosimetry measurement would need to be calibrated for the plasma type. 
In order to improve the scheme, it is not difficult to envision alterations in which layers of 
different polymers are spin-coated on the wafer to allow an underlying polymer film to be 
partially protected, and to allow VUV exposure to be recorded in structural chemical changes. 
Multiple polymer layers with different functional groups may provide information about the 
VUV spectrum since different functional groups often absorb at different wavelengths93,95. This 
method  of  determining  the  VUV  flux  or  fluence  lends  itself  easily  to  spatially-resolved 
measurements on the wafer.  Furthermore, unlike VUV or OES spectrometers that yield line of 
sight values within the bulk plasma and must account for radiation trapping or reabsorption35,73 
the VUV fluence directly to the wafer surface can be measured.

6.5   Conclusion 
 
Vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) emissions from a 25 W – 400 W, 10 mT – 50 mT Ar ICP were 
characterized. The dominant 104.8 nm and 106.7 nm emission lines were identified and the 
absolute calibrated flux was on the order of ~1016 photons/cm2/s. The chemical modifications 
(C=O and C–O–C depletion) to 193 nm PR processed under these Ar ICP conditions were 
attributed  to  VUV  photoabsorption  and  were  a  function  of  VUV  fluence  (exposure  time). 
Complementary experiments conducted in a vacuum beam system where 193 nm PR samples 
were irradiated with Xe VUV photons demonstrated similar bulk modifications as a function of 
VUV fluence.  The C=O ester and lactone loss within the 193 nm PR were quantified as a 
function of the VUV fluences, consequently demonstrating the application of 193 nm PR as a 
chemical dosimeter for VUV fluence measurements. Practical application of 193 nm PR as a 
chemical dosimeter demonstrated that VUV emissions from a dielectric barrier discharge used in 
bio-medical  antisepsis  and  sterilization  applications  emitted  negligible  VUV  emissions 
apparently due to reabsorption in the atmosphere.

Chapter 7 – Modeling Vacuum Ultraviolet Photon 
Penetration Depth and C=O Bond Depletion in 193 
nm Photoresist 
 
 
7.1   Abstract 
 
As demonstrated in Chapter 6, vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photons are known to modify bulk 
chemical composition of 193 nm photoresist (PR), typically penetrating ~100 nm and depleting 
carbon-oxygen  bonds.  Fourier  transform  infrared  (FTIR)  transmission  measurements  as  a 
function of VUV photon fluence demonstrate that VUV-induced bond breaking occurs over a 
period of time.  This chapter presents a model based on the idea that VUV photons initially 
deplete near-surface O-containing bonds, leading to deeper, subsequent penetration and more 
bond losses, until the remaining near-surface C–C bonds are able to absorb the incident radiation. 
Fitted model photoabsorption cross sections compare well with literature values.   
 
 
7.2   Introduction 
 
Plasma-generated vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) radiation is known to affect surface and sub-surface 
processes during semiconductor manufacturing8,68,74,96. For example, studies have demonstrated 
charge build-up and dielectric breakdown from VUV photon exposure68,88. Roughening of poly-
methyl methacrylate (PMMA) based 193 nm photoresist (PR) has been attributed to synergy 
between plasma generated VUV photons and high energy ion bombardment5,6,10.  In addition, 
smoothing  effects  due  to  VUV  photons  have  been  observed  in  HBr  and  H -containing 
2
plasmas8,96,97.   
 
Fourier  transform  infra-red  (FTIR)  spectroscopy  and  x-ray  photospectroscopy  (XPS) 
analyses of VUV and ion exposed 193 nm PR reveal scissioning and cross-linking of C=O and 
C–O–C bonds95,98. These transformations are sometimes associated with film roughening and 
smoothing12,93,95,98.  While damage due to ion bombardment is limited to the first few nm of the 
79
PR6,99, bulk changes are due to the VUV photons, often penetrating ~80 – 100 nm into the 
PR6,8,10,95.  The penetration depth of VUV photons, often defined as depth of 90 % photon 
absorption, is determined by the VUV absorption spectra of the polymer, or the photoabsorption 
coefficients93,95.  Many authors, including Wertheimer et al.93 and Marasescu et al.95 utilize these 
photoabsorption  coefficients  to  characterize  photon  penetration  for  various  VUV  sources. 
However, these models are generally steady-state and do not account for transient photon-
induced chemical changes in the polymer. Absorption spectra of bulk polymers can change with 
VUV fluence100. Furthermore, FTIR measurements clearly show that C=O and C–O–C bonds are 
broken within the bulk PR, and that the changes to absorption saturate after some fluence.  In this 
chapter, a model of transient photon penetration into 193 nm PR is proposed. Model predictions 
are compared to experimental FTIR results for 193 nm PR exposed to VUV photons from a Xe 
lamp source in a vacuum beam system and an Ar inductively coupled plasma. 
 
 
7.3   Model Development 
 
193 nm PR (Figure 7.1) is modeled in COMSOLTM (a commercial software package) as a one-
dimensional target material comprised of carbon (C) and oxygen (O) species (Figure 7.2). The 
divergence of photon flux through the PR (J ) is equal to the sum of the rates of the photon 
hv
absorption  processes.  Photon  transport  is  treated  as  pseudo-steady  state,  whereas  the  bond 
densities  must  be  treated  as  time-varying.  Only  C–C  bonds  and  ester  and  lactone  groups 
(combining C=O and C–O–C bonds) are included in this simple version of the model. The key 
assumptions are that the photon is absorbed upon breaking the carbon-oxygen (CO) bonds, and 
that the bonds are simultaneously destroyed. The remaining C–C bonds are assumed to be 
unaffected by this process and other possible absorption sites in the polymer are ignored.  
 
Photon absorption is governed by the density of bonds (N , N  and N ) and their 
ester lactone CC
corresponding cross-sections (σ , σ , σ ). These cross-sections are of course a function of 
ester lactone CC
wavelength. The bond site densities are computed using a simple transient continuity equation. 
The model equations are summarized as follows:

In  practice,  the  photoabsorption  cross-sections  (σ)  are  initially  treated  as  adjustable 
parameters. The best fits to the experimental data are compared to literature values. For ester and 
lactone, the cross-sections (σ) are adjusted until the simulated ester and lactone bond density loss 
i
(integrated through the film depth) matches the experimental results of FTIR transmission for the 
corresponding absorption band. The C–C cross-section (σ ) is adjusted until the desired photon 
CC
penetration depth of ~100 nm is achieved. The surface (x = 0 nm) VUV photon flux (J ) is 
hv,0
arbitrarily defined and the simulation time is adjusted to match experimental VUV fluence 
measurements. Note that absolute photon fluxes are measured experimentally, allowing the 
model to be tested for absolute cross sections. Given the known polymer stoichiometry and 
density, the initial bond group concentrations (N m-3) are calculated (Table 7.1).

7.4   Results & Discussion 
 
Model results are compared to two sets of experimental studies carried out in a vacuum beam 
system and an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) system, respectively, both described previously 
in Chapter 6.  In review, a temperature controlled, 1 cm2 piece of PR-coated Si wafer is exposed 
to a Xe lamp VUV emission line source (147 nm) mounted in a vacuum beam system, where 
pressure is maintained below 10-5 Torr. The VUV spectrum was monitored with a calibrated 
Resonance LTD VSFS92 VUV spectrometer.  Samples received a VUV flux of ~1.9 × 1014 
photons/cm2/s and the exposure time was varied (30 s – 60 min) to achieve VUV fluences similar 
to that of substrates exposed to typical low pressure plasmas during plasma etch processes.  
Similarly, a 1 cm2 sample was placed in the ICP system on a temperature- (50 °C) and bias-
controlled (zero bias used here) holder and exposed to a 10 mT, 70 W, Ar plasma for varying 
81
times. The plasma is also monitored with the calibrated VUV spectrometer (104.8 nm and 106.7 
nm VUV lines), in addition to a wall-mounted ion current probe (~0.8 mA/cm2), optical emission 
spectrometer (Ocean Optics PC2000-UV-vis-ISA), and a Langmuir probe (plasma potential ~ 16 
eV). The PR samples were 250 nm – 300 nm thick films (commercial 193 nm PMMA-based; 
Rohm and Haas) coated on Si wafers. All processed samples were characterized with Fourier 
transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) (Digilab FTS-3000). Changes in the C=O peaks for ester 
and  lactone  groups  (1720,  1738,  and  1796  cm-1),  C–O–C  peaks  (1050  –  1350  cm-1),  and 
CH /CH  peaks (2800 – 3100 cm-1) were monitored.  
2 3
 
In  Chapter  6,  the  experimental  results  demonstrated  that  193  nm  PR  is  chemically 
modified as it is exposed to VUV photons. For increasing VUV fluence, FTIR analysis shows a 
30 – 50 % decrease in C=O and C–O–C peaks while CH /CH  stretching regions remain nearly 
2 3
unaffected. The observed drop in CO bonds is equivalent to ~100 nm of VUV photon-induced 
bond destruction, while the unaffected CH /CH  regions indicate no substantial etching of the PR 
2 3
has occurred6,10,36. The experimental data are reproduced here for the Xe-lamp exposures (Figure 
7.3) and for the Ar plasma exposures (Figure 7.4), plotting the remaining fraction of ester and 
lactone species (from FTIR C=O measurements) as a function of VUV fluence.  In addition, the 
simulation results for the remaining fraction of ester and lactone bond densities as a function of 
VUV fluence are also plotted.  
 
The simulated FTIR measurements for each bond group are obtained by integrating the 
bond density (N) with depth. Good agreement is obtained between simulation and experiment 
i
for the ester and lactone groups in the Xe-lamp VUV exposure case, while slight differences are 
observed in the Ar-plasma case. This is attributed to differences in VUV wavelengths in the two 
experiments.  In  particular,  for  emissions  from  Ar  plasmas  (104.8  nm  and  106.7  nm), 
photoionization may occur, thus changing the photochemistry within the PR100,101. Furthermore, 
PR samples processed in the Ar plasma are exposed to additional species such as low-energy 
ions (16 eV), metastables (~ 11.5 eV) and photons from the visible and near-UV spectrum. FTIR 
measurements indicate that lactone is sensitive to longer (UV-visible) wavelengths.  This effect 
is neglected for simplicity.

As mentioned in section 7.3, the ester, lactone and C–C photoabsorption cross-sections 
were treated as adjustable parameters.  The 'best fit' cross-sections for the Xe-lamp conditions 
and Ar-plasma conditions are given in Table 7.2.  The ester and lactone cross-sections were 
adjusted to achieve similar C=O fractional losses to the experiment. The C–C cross-section was 
adjusted to achieve ~100 nm photon penetration at long times and resulted in ~91 nm and 87 nm 
penetration depth for the Xe and Ar cases, respectively. Xe lamp-generated photons tend to 
penetrate deeper (Figure 7.5) due to their smaller cross-section relative to photons generated in 
the Ar plasma93,95. 
 
Fitted cross-sections were compared to cross-sections of corresponding functional groups 
found in the literature. For ester (HCOOCH ) species, reported cross-sections are on the order of 
3
10 ~ 35 × 10-18 cm2 for VUV wavelengths between ~106 nm – 250 nm102,103.  Cross-sections for 
alkane and alkene groups vary from 7 × 10-19 – 6 × 10-16 cm2 for VUV wavelengths ranging 
between ~107 nm – 183 nm104.  The fitted cross-section values for ester and C–C species fall 
well within the expected range for VUV wavelengths on the order of ~100 nm – 200 nm used in 
the experimental studies. The lactone group (cyclical ester) is also of the same order since 
absorption spectra of carboxyl compounds are often similar due to the active electrons in the 
C=O bond103.

Figure 7.5 Simulated Xe and Ar VUV-photon penetration depths in 193 nm PR. Penetration depths are defined as 
the depth at which the photon flux is 10 % of its initial value. 
83
Model results for integrated bond group densities vs. fluence (cf Figures 7.3 and 7.4) can 
be understood by examining how the transient photon fluxes through the film affect the bond 
density spatial profiles. Photons are readily absorbed by CO bonds due to their large cross-
sections (σ  > σ ), thus preferentially breaking the CO bonds. After some fluence, the top 
CO CC
region becomes depleted of CO species while the remaining C–C species continue to absorb 
photons. Eventually, the C–C region (i.e. the CO depleted region) is thick enough that most 
incident photons are absorbed without breaking any more CO bonds.  Approaching steady state, 
the C–C species within the top layer of the PR limits the penetration depth of the photons to the 
top ~100 nm.   
 
Figures  7.6  and  7.7  demonstrates  model  predictions  of  the  changing  concentration 
profiles of CO bond group densities and photon flux within the PR for the five Ar VUV fluences 
studied in Figure 7.4. As photons penetrate the surface, a propagating front develops, separating 
the photon-damaged region and the unaltered polymer.  The concentration (or flux) of photons 
decreases with depth due to absorption. The photon flux reaches ~ 10 % of its initial value at ~ 
100 nm. The separation between the de-oxygenated region and unprocessed polymer matches the 
experimental FTIR results that were interpreted to have lost 30 – 50% of the C=O and C–O–C 
species.  
 
Of course, this simple model can be readily adapted to simulate photon penetration 
depths of varying VUV wavelengths by adjusting the photoabsorption cross-section values.  The 
model may be improved by incorporating other functional groups in the polymer, to understand 
their impact on photon penetration. In addition, loss of C–C or addition of C=C species due to 
cross-linking may be included to determine their impact on photon penetration.

7.5   Conclusion 
 
A numerical simulation of VUV-photoabsorption and C=O specie depletion in 193 nm PR was 
modeled after experimental results for Xe-VUV and Ar-VUV irradiation in the vacuum beam 
system and ICP system, respectively.  The photoabsorption cross-sections of C–C and C=O ester 
and lactone species are a function of VUV wavelength and were used as adjustable parameters to 
achieve  oxygen  loss  and  photon  penetration  depths  comparable  to  experiment.  C=O  cross-
sections are responsible for the rate of oxygen depletion in the PR while C–C cross-sections are 
responsible for slowing the front of penetrating photons and limiting the damaged region to ~ 
100 nm.  For Xe irradiation, the ester, lactone, and C-C cross-sections were 5 × 10-18 cm2, 80 × 
10-18 cm2, and 2 × 10-18 cm2, respectively.  The maximum photon penetration depth was ~ 91 nm. 
For Ar irradiation the ester, lactone, and C–C cross-sections were 10 × 10-18 cm2, 100 × 10-18 cm2, 
and 2.5 × 10-18 cm2, respectively.  The maximum photon penetration depth was ~ 87 nm.

Chapter 8 – Comparing 193 nm Photoresist 
Roughening in an Inductively Coupled Plasma 
System and Vacuum Beam System 
 
 
8.1   Abstract 
 
This chapter presents a comparison of blanket 193 nm photoresist (PR) roughening and chemical 
modifications  of  samples  processed  in  a  well  characterized  argon  (Ar)  inductively  coupled 
plasma (ICP) system and an ultra-high vacuum beam system. In addition, patterned samples are 
processed in the ICP system to determine if roughening of features (line-width roughness, LWR) 
correlate with surface roughening behavior. In the ICP system, PR samples are irradiated with Ar 
VUV and Ar ions, while in the vacuum beam system, samples are irradiated with either a Xe-line 
VUV source or Ar-lamp VUV source with Ar ions. Sample temperature, photon flux, ion flux, 
and ion energy are controlled and measured. The resulting chemical modifications to bulk 193 
nm PR and surface roughness are analyzed with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy 
and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM).   
 
Results  demonstrate  that  under  VUV-only  conditions  in  the  vacuum  beam  and  ICP 
systems, blanket and patterned 193 nm PR does not roughen. However, roughness increases with 
simultaneous high-energy (> 70 eV) ion bombardment and VUV-irradiation and is a function of 
VUV fluence, substrate temperature and photon-to-ion flux ratio.  Analysis of patterned samples 
demonstrate a similar synergy between VUV photons and ions on LWR, however, the LWR 
remains independent of processing temperature. PR processed in the ICP system experience 
increased  etching,  probably  due  to  release  of  H-  and  O-containing  gaseous  products  and 
subsequent chemical etching, in contrast to samples in the vacuum beam system. The surface 
roughness structure and behavior between the two systems, however, remain similar and is 
attributed to the synergy between VUV-photons and positive ions.

8.2   Introduction 
 
Photoresists based on polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), designed for use with ArF (193 nm) 
excimer laser radiation, are known to be susceptible to surface roughening. Roughening often 
occurs during lithography steps (i.e. the exposure/development/post-exposure bake cycle), and 
can appear as top surface roughness and/or sidewall roughness on features such as lines and 
spaces or holes and vias. Additionally, plasmas used for etching-induced pattern transfer to 
underlying films are known to either smooth or further roughen features.  
 
Plasma-induced  roughening  of  193  nm  photoresist  (PR)  exists  in  many  forms  and 
generates significant problems in device performance due to degradation of features during the 
pattern transfer step. The term 'contact edge roughness' (CER) refers to the problem for rough 
contact holes (Figure 8.1a). Sidewall roughness in lines and spaces is described as 'line edge 
roughness' (LER) or 'line width roughness' (LWR), depending on whether the feature edge or 
width of the feature line is measured, respectively (Figure 8.1b). Surface roughening of non-
patterned (blanket) samples are prevalent even in inert plasmas where chemistry effects are 
absent (Figure 8.1c).

LWR is generally acknowledged to be a major problem for gate electrode leakage as well 
as other device performance characteristics as device sizes continue to shrink below the current 
32 nm node1,9. LWR roughness is often characterized by the distribution of line widths (assumed 
Gaussian) along a feature edge such as a gate electrode. The difference between the root mean 
square (RMS) width of the distribution and the width at three times the mean of the distribution 
('3σ') should be less than 2 nm for the 22 nm node devices, to minimize device gate leakage. This 
goal is proving difficult to meet, and the relative paucity of potential lithography-related means 
to meet minimal smoothness specs has prompted interest in seeking post-litho, plasma-based 
schemes, to achieve the goals.  
 
Little  is  currently  known,  however,  about  the  principles  of  plasma-based  surface 
texturing for any polymer, including the complex polymer blends used for photoresists.  More 
recent studies have investigated the cause of 193 nm PR roughening in a number of plasma 
systems. For example, effects of plasma chemistry and process control parameters such as power 
and pressure on 193 nm PR LER and LWR have been studied12,56,57,96,106.  Results have shown 
that LER and LWR in C F /Ar plasma discharges are attributed to fluorine penetration in the 
4 8
polymer structure and fluorocarbon (FC) deposition on the sidewalls, where the FC sticking 
coefficients are dependent upon the plasma operating condition56,57. These studies typically 
consider the effects of neutral, radical and ion species on PR degradation and roughening.  The 
roughening observed however neglects the effects of vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) radiation on the 
polymer structure, which has been proven to be a critical component of 193 nm PR roughening.  
   
Focus on the effects of VUV photochemistry on polymers has greatly increased since 
VUV can be produced in significant quantities in processing plasmas93,100,101.  An important 
feature  of  hydrocarbon-based  polymers,  such  as  193  nm  PR,  is  the  large  photoabsorption 
coefficients in the VUV region of the spectrum (< 200 nm)36,93,95,100.  Depending on photon 
energy (or wavelength), photoexcitation or photoionization may occur in the bulk polymer and 
significantly  transform  the  material  via  chain  scissioning,  radical  formation,  and  cross-
linking93,100. Thus it has grown increasingly important to study plasma-induced VUV effects on 
193 nm PR in addition to effects associated with ion, neutral, and radical species. 
 
Some groups have proposed plasma pre-treatment known as “plasma cures” and VUV/e-
beam  smoothing  of  193  nm  PR  to  eliminate  LER  and  LWR7,8,11,58,97,107,108.  Pargon  et  al. 
demonstrated that HBr and Ar plasma treatments reduce LWR and attributed the effect to VUV 
emission (110 – 210 nm) and low energy ion bombardment7,11.  Smoothing was proposed to be 
due to the known effects of VUV light on chemical modification of the bulk PR through 
scissioning polymer chains and depleting the PR of C=O compounds. This removal of C=O 
species was thought to contribute to a lower molecular weight and mobile volume with a 
decreased glass transition temperature (T ) that led to a final smaller PR roughness. 
g
 
Most recently, the dissertation by Dustin Nest demonstrated that 193 nm PR roughening 
and degradation correlated with the synergistic effects of VUV radiation, ion bombardment and 
substrate heating6,10,62.  His experiments conducted in a vacuum beam apparatus, demonstrated 
that 193 nm PR samples roughened most when heated and exposed to simultaneous VUV photon 
(from Xe and Ar resonance lines) and ion (Ar+) bombardment. Roughening on the order of 1 – 5 
nm RMS was observed along with accompanying degradation of carbonyl (C=O) bonds due to 
88
VUV  exposure.  248  nm  PR  (utilized  as  control  samples)  exposed  to  identical  conditions, 
remained smooth.  
   
Although these ultra-high vacuum beam studies demonstrate a synergy between ion 
bombardment and VUV photons leading to enhanced PR roughening, the question remains of 
whether this synergy exists in complex plasma systems where real device features are etched. 
Previous Ar plasma experiments showed PR roughening similar to that observed in the vacuum 
beam system, but the dependence of the roughening synergy on the various conditions in the 
plasma is not known. It is true that plasma etch processes generally utilize complex feed-gases 
and this no doubt influences the roughening mechanisms5,56.  
 
In order to begin to understand the roughening mechanism of 193 nm PR under realistic 
plasma etch conditions, preliminary experiments investigated smoothing and roughening effects 
in a relatively simple, well-characterized, mostly chemically inert, inductively coupled argon 
(Ar) plasma. First, “plasma cure” conditions were generated to measure the effects of VUV 
photons on bulk chemistry and surface morphology on blanket 193 nm PR samples. Secondly, 
the synergistic effects of substrate temperature, ion energy, VUV fluence, and photon-to-ion flux 
ratio on surface roughness of blanket samples were investigated and compared to experimental 
results obtained in the ultra-high vacuum beam experiments. Roughening mechanisms of 193 nm 
PR blanket samples are proposed from the results.  Finally, the effects of VUV photons and ions 
on patterned samples are studied to determine if there is a correlation between LWR and surface 
roughness of features.  
 
 
8.3   Photoresist Materials & Characterization Techniques 
 
8.3.1   Blanket 193 nm and 248 nm Photoresists 
 
Experiments  focus  on  the  surface  roughening  and  degradation  of  polymethyl  methacrylate 
(PMMA) based 193 nm PR (Dow Electronic Materials).  The chemical structure (Figure 8.2) 
consists  of  methyl  adamantyl  methacrylate  (MAMA)  in  the  leaving  group,  α-gamma 
butyrolactone methacrylate (a-GBLMA) in the lactone group, and R-functionalized adamantyl 
methacrylate (RAMA) in the polar group for adhesion.  Commercially available 248 nm PR 
materials are used in control experiments since they are known to remain smooth during plasma 
treatment. The polymer consists of hydroxystyrene, styrene, and tert-butylacrylate (Figure 8.3).  
Glass transition temperature (T ) values for unprocessed 193 and 248 nm PRs are 180 °C and 
g
100 °C, respectively. 
 
193 nm PR polymers are spin-coated (250 – 300 nm) on 200 mm diameter wafers 
without photoacid generator or base quencher. 1 – 2 cm2 samples are cleaved and mounted on a 
sample holder with thermal paste (Apiezon H Hi Temp Vacuum Grease) prior to plasma or beam 
exposures. Irradiated samples are analyzed with transmission Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) 
spectroscopy.   193 nm PR is monitored for changes in the C=O peaks for the ester and lactone 
groups (1720, 1738, and 1796 cm-1), C-O-C peaks (1050 – 1350 cm-1) and CH /CH  peaks (2800 
2 3
– 3100 cm-1) (Figure 8.4 a-c).  Changes in 248 nm PR are monitored in the CH and ring 
89
deformations  (500  –  900  cm-1),  C=O/C-O-C/C=C  regions  (1000  –  1800  cm-1),  and 
CH/CH /CH /OH regions (2800 – 3800 cm-1) (Figure 8.4 d-f). 
2 3
  
Tapping-mode  atomic  force  microscopy  (AFM)  (Digital  Instruments)  is  used  to 
characterize the surface morphology of the PRs.  Typically 1 μm × 1 μm surface areas are 
measured. Processed 193 nm PR samples are compared to the very smooth pristine sample, with 
typical RMS roughness values of ~ 0.3 nm (Figure 8.5).  
    
After FTIR and AFM measurements, samples are dipped in neat tetrahydrofuran (THF) at 
room temperature and dried with N  gas. Samples are visually inspected for a remaining film, 
2
determined  to  be  a  graphitized  layer,  insoluble  in  THF109.    Molecular  dynamics  (MD) 
simulations have demonstrated that graphitized, dehydrogenated layers 1 – 2 nm thick form on 
the surface of polymers during energetic ion bombardment (Figure 8.6)99,110.

8.3.2   Patterned 193 nm Photoresists 
 
193  nm  PR  samples  (~  1  cm2)  patterned  with  lines  of  varying  critical  dimensions  (Lam 
Research) were cleaved from 12 inch wafers and mounted on the temperature and bias controlled 
sample holder with thermal paste prior to plasma processing. Three patterned samples and one 
control blanket sample were processed per exposure condition. The line features are comprised 
of pad oxide, SiN, BARC, and 193 nm PR layers (Figure 8.7). Scanning electron microscope 
(SEM) scans taken at Lam Research measured line segments of varying length to yield high and 
low frequency LWR values. It has been observed in practice that high frequency LWR is 
typically easier to treat than low frequency LWR.  Large surface areas of unpatterned PR were 
measured with AFM to determine RMS surface roughness (Figure 8.8). Initial roughness values 
of pristine patterned samples (RMS 1.88 nm) were quite high and most likely a result from 
previous photolithography steps.

8.4   Experimental Approach 
 
8.4.1   Inductively Coupled Plasma System 
 
Blanket and patterned 193 nm PR samples are processed in the inductively coupled plasma (ICP) 
chamber with the diagnostic tools and sample holder that have been described in detail in 
Chapter 2. The specific set-up relevant to this study is briefly repeated here. An argon (Ar) 
plasma is generated and sustained in the ICP reactor through a 5-turn, planar coil, powered with 
a 13.56 MHz RF power source. PR samples are introduced into the chamber through the side-
wall, load-lock port, on the temperature (20 – 100 °C) and bias (0 – 420 V, peak-to-peak) 
controlled holder.  The samples are placed flush with the chamber wall.  The bias is controlled 
with a 13.56 MHz RF power supply and the temperature is set with a Neslab RTE-111 water 
bath. To monitor temperature control, sample temperatures in the ICP chamber were measured 
with Omega Four-Point irreversible temperature indicators attached to the sample.  
 
A quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS, UTI-300) is used to monitor positive ion species 
generated in the plasma, an optical emission spectrometer (OES, Ocean Optics PC2000-UV-
VIS-ISA) is used to monitor the 811.5 nm Ar emission line to ensure plasma stability throughout 
the experiments, and a Langmuir probe is used to measure the plasma density (n ), temperature 
e
(T ), and potential (Ф ).  The total positive ion current is measured with an ion current probe, 
e p
adjacent to the sample holder.  The VUV flux is calculated from the total measured VUV 
intensities directly opposite the sample holder13,36.  The ion energy is calculated as the sum of the 
plasma potential and average bias voltage. The VUV and ion fluences are controlled by adjusting 
the exposure times (5 s – 5 min).  Table 8.1 summarizes the plasma experimental conditions 
studied and used for comparison to the vacuum beam system experiments.

8.4.2   Ultra High Vacuum Beam System 
 
All 193 nm PR experiments conducted in the ICP system are compared to those previously done 
in  the  vacuum  beam  system.  The  vacuum  beam  system  set-up,  experimentation,  and  post 
processing techniques are described in detail by the dissertation of Dustin Nest62.  For reference, 
a brief description will be given here.  
 
The vacuum beam chamber is maintained at a base pressure of 5 × 10-8 Torr where a 
temperature-controlled, rotational-translational sample dock is introduced through a load-lock 
transfer arm (Figure 8.9). The chamber is equipped with a Commonwealth ion gun, accelerating 
Ar ions (Ar+) to 150 eV at 90° incidence angle to the sample. The ion current is measured with a 
commercial Faraday cup (Kiethley). Samples were irradiated with Ar or Xe VUV photons from 
either an Oxford Applied Research (OAR) (HD25) inductively coupled plasma source with 
13.56 MHz excitation frequency, or a Xe VUV line source (Resonance Ltd.). In addition, the 
vacuum beam system is equipped with a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM, Maxtek Inc. Model 
TM-400).  QCM samples spin-coated with PR (250 nm thick) were used to measure mass change, 
in-situ, during exposure to ions and photons.  All 193 nm PR samples were irradiated with ion-
only, VUV-only, or simultaneous ion and VUV beams. 
 
The  vacuum  beam  system  VUV  sources  are  monitored  with  the  same  calibrated 
Resonance LTD VSFS92 VUV spectrometer as used in the ICP system.  The VUV spectrometer 
is mounted directly opposite, line-of-sight, from the VUV sources. The VUV emission intensities 
(or VUV flux) from the OAR source are tuned by adjusting source power and pressure. The 
Resonance VUV line source, however, operates at fixed pressure and power; therefore the 
emission intensity can only be controlled by translating the source with respect to the sample.  In 
some cases, LiF, MgF , CaF , and SiO  windows were mounted between the VUV source and 
2 2 2
spectrometer to filter wavelengths below 104 nm, 112 nm, 122 nm, and 160 nm, respectively111.  
The calculated Xe (147 nm) photon flux was 1.24 × 1013 and 1.9 × 1014 photons/cm2/s for the 
OAR (190 mT, 100 W) and Resonance sources, respectively.  The total photon flux from the 
OAR source with Ar was not calculated due to additional VUV  peaks generated at lower 
wavelengths (below the 100 nm spectrometer cut-off) that could not be characterized62.  Table 
8.2 summarizes the experimental conditions studied in the vacuum beam system and used for 
comparison to the plasma exposures. 
 
The advantage of a vacuum beam system is that it is a highly controlled processing 
environment in comparison to the ICP system. The effects of VUV photons and ions can be 
quantitatively monitored without interference from other plasma generated species (eg. neutrals 
and radicals). In addition, chemistry effects are negligible since sputtered products are rapidly 
swept away through the turbo-pump system. It should be noted, however, that processing times 
are orders of magnitude different. While ICP samples are processed a few seconds or minutes, 
due to the low-fluence VUV and ion sources of the vacuum beam system, processing times are 
on the order of hours.

8.5   Results & Discussion 
 
8.5.1   VUV Characterization 
 
Prior to evaluation of PR response to process control parameters, the ICP VUV spectrum was 
characterized in order to determine the appropriate exposure conditions for comparison to the 
vacuum beam experiments36. For a detailed discussion on VUV emission behavior for the Ar 
plasma, see Chapters 3 and 6.  Here, the VUV emission characteristics relevant to this study are 
briefly discussed.  
 
Figure 8.10 displays the VUV spectrum for an Ar plasma for four pressures at 110 W.  
For all pressures, the dominant 104.8 nm and 106.7 nm Ar emission lines are observed. The high 
intensity peaks at 209 nm and 213 nm are double-peaks of the 104.8 nm and 106.7 nm emissions 
and were verified with a MgF  window mounted in front of the VUV, filtering wavelengths < 
2
112 nm36,72.  The band between 140 – 210 nm is attributed to CO VUV emissions from the 
fourth positive band70,71. The 10 mT Ar plasma condition is chosen for PR exposure experiments 
reported here in order to minimize the VUV flux of the CO contaminant and maximize the Ar 
VUV flux. The VUV fluxes hitting the substrate, calculated from the measured Ar emission lines, 
are listed in Table 8.1. QMS measurements indicate that the CO+ flux is ~140 times lower than 
the flux of Ar+ for the primary condition investigated (10 mT, 70 W). The corresponding Ar+ 
flux is also given in Table 8.1. 
 
The Xe VUV line emission source used in the vacuum beam system experiments was 
characterized with the calibrated VUV spectrometer.  The 147 nm VUV emission line from the 
Xe Resonance source is shown in Figure 8.11; the photon fluxes are given in Table 8.2.  As 
previously mentioned, the OAR Ar lamp source could not be characterized with the VUV 
spectrometer due to additional peaks observed below the spectrometer’s lower limit.

2 3
and on the lower electrode at r = 0 cm, 2.5 cm, and 5.5 cm. 
 
 
 
In the ICP system, chamber symmetry is assumed, therefore the VUV flux measured 
opposite the sample holder should be equivalent to that received by the 193 nm PR sample. This 
is a reasonable assumption since the spatial variations of the VUV emission generated in the Ar 
plasma are considered negligible for the conditions investigated. Figure 8.12 displays the FTIR 
spectra for 193 nm PR samples processed on the sample holder 2.54 cm above the lower 
electrode, and for samples placed at different radii (r = 0 cm, 2.5 cm, 5.5 cm) on the lower 
electrode in a 10 mT, 100 W Ar plasma for 20 s.  (Simulation studies demonstrated the most 
significant spatial variation should occur for this plasma condition). The observed changes in the 
C=O and CH /CH  peaks for each sample location are identical, differing by only 1.5 % – 3 % 
2 3
indicating the plasma is likely optically thick. 
 
 
8.5.2   Plasma Cure & VUV – Only Exposures 
 
Plasma cure processing was conducted in the ICP chamber at 10 mT, 70 W, and zero-bias 
voltage (Table 8.1, condition 2). (All experiments conducted in the ICP system will henceforth 
be referred to as the Ar-ICP condition). Therefore, samples received only low energy (~16 eV) 
ions and Ar VUV flux (104.8 nm and 106.7 nm emissions). The resulting chemical modifications 
to  the  bulk  PR  was  measured  via  FTIR  analysis  and  compared  to  VUV-only  exposures 
conducted in the vacuum beam system (Table 8.2, conditions 2 and 3). (All vacuum beam system 
experiments will henceforth be referred to as the Xe-beam and Ar-beam conditions). Figure 8.13 
plots the transmission FTIR spectra for 193 nm PR samples exposed to Xe and Ar VUV photons 
for a range of fluence (cf Table 8.2, conditions 2 and 3) and for Ar VUV photon exposure (5 s – 
5 min) in the plasma system.  The FTIR spectra clearly demonstrate the dynamic dependence of 
the bulk modifications of 193 nm PR on VUV fluence and photon wavelength.

As the photon fluence increases, all irradiated samples show a corresponding depletion of 
C=O and C-O-C species. In both Xe-beam and Ar-ICP cases, the loss of carbon-oxygen (CO) 
bonds saturates after ~ 1 × 1018 photons/cm2. A similar saturation (from 2.5 - 11.5 hrs) is 
observed in the Ar-beam experiment although the total VUV fluence is unknown.  The saturated 
loss of CO species is attributed to photoabsorption cross-sections of the photons and the resulting 
penetration  depth  ~100  nm6,10,36,112.  As  the  ester  and  lactone  peaks  (1724  and  1793  cm-1) 
decrease,  a  rise  in  the  free  lactone  peak  (1772  cm-1)  is  observed  and  is  consistent  with 
observations by other groups10,11,62.  The additional free lactone peak observed in the Xe-beam 
case, however, is greater than that observed in both Ar-beam and Ar-ICP cases. Furthermore, an 
additional peak is observed in the Xe-beam case near 1680 – 1700 cm-1 and is associated with 
the formation of carboxylic acid dimers11.  This difference between Ar and Xe VUV exposure is 
attributed to the difference in VUV wavelengths. At higher energy (lower) wavelengths such as 
those observed in the Ar-beam and Ar-ICP conditions (104.8 and 106.7 nm), photoionization 
may occur and thus change the photochemistry within the PR100,101,112. It should be noted that 
although each experiment was conducted with different sample temperatures, the temperature 
does  not  affect  the  bulk-chemical  modification  and  only  affects  surface  roughening6,  as 
discussed in section 8.5.3.4.  
 
At early times (~ 1 × 1016 photons/cm2), the lactone peak decreases faster than the ester 
peak. This is attributed to the sensitivity of the lactone group to longer (UV-visible) wavelengths 
and is more pronounced in the Ar-ICP case where high intensity visible emissions from the 
plasma are present. The larger decrease in the ester peak for the Ar-ICP case appears to be due to 
98
the plasma ignition protocol. The lack of capacitive coupling from the coil prevents the discharge 
from igniting, and powering the lower electrode for several seconds allows the plasma to ignite. 
This appears to create a burst of VUV photons (i.e. initially higher VUV flux) and high energy 
ions (see Chapter 3, section 3.3.2).   
 
FTIR peaks associated with the CH /CH  regions demonstrate little to no change after 
2 3
VUV exposure in both Xe-beam and Ar-beam cases. Similarly, the Ar-ICP case shows little 
change, even with ~16 eV ion bombardment. Therefore, no significant etching of the PR (or loss 
of the polymer backbone) due to VUV irradiation is observed and CO loss is attributed to bulk 
modifications of the PR caused by VUV photons. At higher fluence, a shift in the CH /CH  peak 
2 3
(2920 cm-1) and rise at 2877 cm-1 is observed and is associated with the formation of C=C 
bonds95. Again, a larger change is observed in the Xe-beam case compared to both the Ar-beam 
and Ar-ICP cases and is attributed to the difference in wavelength and resulting photochemistry. 
 
The fraction of remaining C=O lactone and CH /CH  species is calculated from the FTIR 
2 3
data and plotted in Figure 8.14 for the Ar-ICP and Xe-beam exposures. As previously noted, the 
lack of significant CH /CH  loss is interpreted as meaning no etching occurs due to VUV-only 
2 3
exposures. In contrast, a 40 – 60 % loss of C=O species is observed and attributed to the 
photoabsorption and destruction of CO bonds by VUV photons.  As the VUV photons are 
absorbed by CO bonds (resulting in loss of O in the form of CO), the near-surface region of the 
PR is increasingly depleted of CO bonds. When this carbon-rich layer is about 100 nm thick, it is 
able to absorb most of the incident photons112.  Ultimately, the CO loss saturates at ~ 1 × 1018 
photons/cm2  6,112.  The larger decrease in CO species observed for PR irradiated with Xe photons 
is likely due to the difference in wavelength. The longer Xe wavelength can penetrate farther, 
thus  scissioning  more  CO  bonds95,112  but  is  lower  in  energy  therefore  not  inducing 
photoionization reactions in the PR100,101,112. 
 
AFM measurements of processed samples show 193 nm PR does not roughen with VUV-
only exposures.  A pristine 193 nm PR sample is typically on the order of 0.3 nm RMS (cf Figure 
8.5). Ar-ICP and Xe-beam samples exposed to increasing VUV fluence demonstrate a similar 
roughness  (Figure  8.15)  confirming  that  VUV-only  exposures  do  not  induce  193  nm  PR 
roughening6,10,62.  In addition, samples dipped in concentrated THF do not show the formation of 
a graphitized layer on the PR surface. 
 
As a control experiment 248 nm PR was exposed to VUV-only conditions in both the 
vacuum beam and ICP systems. Comparisons between FTIR and AFM measurements of samples 
processed in both systems show similar trends.  FTIR measurements indicate little etching occurs 
(i.e. no decrease in the CH /CH  region) while the –OH band is reduced (Figure 8.16). Fewer 
2 3
bulk modification of the PR is observed and attributed to the lower oxygen content of 248 nm 
PR10,62.  AFM measurements show roughening does not occur and remains similar to pristine 
roughness values (~0.3 nm) (Figure 8.17). In contrast to 193 nm PR, THF-dipped samples show 
strong cross-linking for VUV-only exposed samples.

8.5.3   Simultaneous VUV and Ion Exposures 
 
8.5.3.1   Effect of VUV photon fluence 
 
The synergistic effects of VUV-photon and ion bombardment on 193 nm PR were investigated in 
the ICP system (cf Table 8.1, condition 2) and compared to studies in the vacuum beam system 
(cf Table 8.2, condition 6).  The FTIR absorbance spectra for plasma and simultaneous VUV and 
ion exposed samples are shown in Figure 8.18.   
 
As observed with the VUV-only exposure cases, there is a rapid depletion of C=O and C-
O-C bond structures that increases with VUV fluence and the variation between experiments is 
attributed to the difference in photon wavelengths, as discussed in the previous section. Note, 
that reproducibility in the vacuum beam system can vary as shown in the two 60 min exposure 
cases. The greatest difference between Xe-beam and Ar-ICP exposed samples are observed in 
the CH /CH  regions. A significant decrease in the CH /CH  peaks for the plasma-exposed 
2 3 2 3
samples indicate film etching occurs with the presence of 120 eV Ar+ in the plasma system, as 
opposed to samples bombarded with 150 eV Ar+ in the vacuum beam system. Measurements of 
ion  mass  spectra  (Figure  8.19)  and  optical  emission  spectra  show  the  presence  of  small 
concentrations of O-, and H-containing species with 120 eV Ar+ bombardment. O+, H+, H O+, 
2
CO+, CO + and CH O + are observed at levels several orders of magnitude below the dominant 
2 x y
Ar+  ion  signal.  These  species  appear  to  be  from  etch  products  formed  during  plasma 
exposure55,113. The lack of film etching in the vacuum beam system with similar ion and photon 
fluences suggests that the presence of these small concentrations of O- and H-containing species 
are themselves responsible for the observed etching rather than just being evidence of low levels 
of etching.

The observed changes in the C=O and CH /CH  peaks in the FTIR spectra are plotted in 
2 3
Figure 8.20 as a function of ion fluence and compared to the  vacuum beam experimental results. 
The primary difference observed when comparing to the VUV-only exposure case (cf Figure 
8.14) is the significant loss of CH /CH  species in the plasma-exposure case. As a result of the 
2 3
etching, the remaining fraction of C=O species does not saturate at 1 × 1018 photons/cm2 in the 
Ar-ICP case as it does for the Xe-beam case. (Note, photon-to-ion ratio is 0.52 and 0.66 for the 
plasma and vacuum beam studies, respectively). 
 
Previous results have demonstrated that the RMS roughness values of simultaneously 
VUV and ion-exposed PRs generally increase with time6,62.  The increased roughening of PRs 
processed  in  both  the  vacuum  beam  (Table  8.2,  condition  6)  and  ICP  system  (Table  8.1, 
condition 2) are shown in Figure 8.21.  Under both conditions, the roughening increases with 
time and does not appear to saturate at 1 × 1018 ions/cm2 as observed with the C=O depletion in 
the FTIR absorbance spectra.  The increase in roughness with VUV fluence (PI ratio for Xe-
beam and Ar-ICP cases are 0.66 and 0.52, respectively), is attributed to the changing mechanical 
properties of the PR8,11.   As the photons penetrate the PR, CO bonds are rapidly scissioned 
causing a decrease in T 8,11.  As the scissioned layer continues to grow with exposure (up to ~100 
g
nm), a larger volume of the PR is modified and induces stress within the top ~2 nm of the PR 
that has been graphitized by ion bombardment99,110.  The mechanical properties of this 2 nm 
surface layer have also been altered from its pristine state and typically exhibit an increased 
molecular weight and T 109,114,115. 
g
 
As a check, 248 nm PRs were processed in both the vacuum beam and ICP systems under 
identical VUV and ion exposure conditions. Although not shown here, the FTIR and analyses 
demonstrated no significant chemical modification was observed while AFM analysis (Figure 
8.22) similarly shows insignificant change to the surface morphology and roughness. Therefore, 
the roughening results observed with the 193 nm PRs are unique to the PR chemical structure. 
 
Representative AFM images of processed 193 nm PR samples from both the vacuum 
beam and ICP systems are shown in Figure 8.23.  A comparison between the vacuum beam and 
ICP processed materials demonstrate similar roughening structures. As the VUV fluence is 
increased, the roughness transitions from the initial, smooth surface (pristine sample ~0.33 nm 
RMS) to a “pebble-like” structure. With continued VUV irradiation, the “pebble” structure 
transitions  into  a  “yarn-like”  structure.    Therefore,  even  with  the  additional  species  (etch-
products,  radicals,  neutrals)  observed  in  the  Ar-ICP  system,  the  roughening  behavior  and 
structure are reproduced with the vacuum beam system for simultaneous VUV photon and ion 
exposure.

8.5.3.2   Effects of Ion Energy 
 
The effect of ion energy on PR surface roughening was studied by varying the applied bias 
voltage to the sample holder in the plasma system. Initially, PR samples were exposed to an Ar 
plasma (10 mT, 70 W) at 50 °C for a range of processing times.  Processed samples were 
measured with FTIR spectroscopy to determine the amount of etching (CH /CH  loss) and AFM 
2 3
to  determine  surface  roughness.  Formation  of  a  graphitized  layer  for  each  sample  was 
determined with THF dips.  
 
FTIR analysis (Figure 8.24) demonstrated that application of larger bias voltages (i.e. 
increasing ion energy above the plasma potential) resulted in increased etching of the PR.  For all 
bias voltages applied, there is an initial lag CH /CH  depletion. However as the C=O species are 
2 3
preferentially removed due to VUV photoabsorption, the concentrated CH /CH  remaining in the 
2 3
top ~100 nm of the PR is continuously etched away and is a function of the ion energy and 
fluence.

The RMS surface roughness of the PR increases with larger bias voltage application 
although the total VUV photon and ion fluences are similar (Figure 8.25).  The sudden increase 
in PR roughness between processing with 47 eV ions and 150 eV ions appeared to indicate that a 
threshold  energy  must  be  overcome  to  initiate  PR  roughening.  The  threshold  energy  was 
determined by processing PR samples in an Ar plasma (10 mT, 70 W) at 50 °C for 5 min (~ 8 – 9 
× 1017 photons/cm2), under various ion energies. The results are plotted in Figure 8.26.  For

PR samples remain smooth and demonstrate no etching when bombarded with plasma 
potential ions (16 eV).  These samples show no evidence that a strong graphitized layer has 
formed when irradiated with primarily VUV photons. As the ion energy is increased to ~65 eV, 
the etching rate increases, however the PR samples remain smooth and THF dips show little-to-
no graphitized layer formation.  When the bombarding ion energy is increased beyond 65 eV, 
there is increased PR roughening. Furthermore, THF dips indicate that a strongly graphitized 
layer has formed on the PR surface. A maximum roughness is observed around 150 – 175 eV 
and then appears to decrease at energies beyond ~200 eV.  Vacuum beam studies of 193 nm PR 
exposure to energetic ions demonstrate a decrease in roughening with increasing ion energy.  
This decrease in roughening may suggest an annealing effect of high energy ions.  
 
The transition from a relatively smooth PR surface with ion energies < 65 eV to a rough 
surface for ions > 65 eV suggests a kind of “threshold energy” or minimal ion energy necessary 
to induce PR roughening. Concurrently, the lack of a graphitized layer for ion energies < 65 eV 
and the formation of the graphitized layer > 65 eV indicates that a graphitized surface layer may 
be the necessary precursor to induce PR roughening.  This is further evidenced by the continuous 
formation  of  the  graphitized  layer  at  higher  energies,  although  the  etch  rate  increases 
substantially with ion energy (Figure 8.27).   
 
It is hypothesized that the ~ 1 – 2 nm ion bombardment-induced graphitized layer at the 
PR  surface  may  be  in  compressive  stress  due  to  the  ions.  Research  has  shown  that  the 
mechanical properties of tetrahedral amorphous carbon (diamond like carbon) or hydrogenated 
tetrahedral  amorphous  carbon  films  deposited  from  carbon  ions  impacting  substrates  are 
dependent upon the carbon ion energies116-118. As the carbon ion energy increases, the mass 
density, sp3 fraction and intrinsic stress of the film increases. The intrinsic stress is typically 
biaxial and compressive. However, above a certain threshold energy, the deposited film mass 
density begins to decrease, as well as the sp3 fraction and intrinsic stress118.  The relation 
between compressive stress developed in a thin diamond film as a function of ion energy has also 
been explored by molecular dynamic (MD) simulations116.  MD simulations demonstrated that 
for low energy ions impacting a surface, (e.g. < 20 eV) the ions are reflected from the film 
without any change. For intermediate energies (e.g. 20 – 80 eV), a local compressive stress was 
observed due to penetration of incident atoms. At higher energies (e.g. 80 – 100 eV), incident 
atoms  penetrated  deeply  and  induced  knock-on  collisions.  McKenzie  et  al.  attributed  this 
behavior as a “thermal spike” where localized melting and rapid chilling of a small region 
occurs116. As the bombarding energy increases, the impacts create a region large enough to flow 
that relieves the accumulated stress.  
 
Since it is known that 100 eV Ar ions transfer energy with > 90 % efficiency to C atoms, 
the top graphitized layer consisting of C atoms should be of an equivalent energy119. Thus as the 
ion bombardment energy in the plasma experiments is increased from 65 eV to 150 eV, the 
density of the graphitized layer probably increases, as does the intrinsic stress, and an increase in 
PR roughening is observed. Above the observed threshold of 150 eV where PR roughening 
begins  to  slightly  decrease,  the  graphitized  film  may  have  likely  transitioned  to  a  slightly 
decreased  density,  lower  fraction  of  sp3  production  and  due  to  a  “thermal  spike”  yields  a 
decreased intrinsic stress in the film.  
 
107
8.5.3.3   Effects of Photon-to-Ion Flux Ratios 
 
The effects of photon-to-ion flux (PI) ratio was investigated in the ICP system by varying the 
deposition power (0 – 200 W) and pressure (10 mT and 50 mT) conditions.   Any dependence of 
surface roughness on PI ratio is complex as the PI ratio itself is complex and behaves differently 
for different pressures (Figure 8.28)36.  It is possible that at higher pressures as the VUV photons 
become trapped and re-absorbed in the plasma the effect of ions becomes increasingly important. 
Coupled with an increasing number of C/H/O-type etch-products and contaminants in the system 
at  higher  pressures,  the  slightest  change  in  ion  composition  may  alter  the  response  of  PR 
roughening (e.g. by competing etching and graphitization rates) and dependence on PI ratio.  
XPS measurements of polymer samples processed in O -plasmas have demonstrated that oxygen 
2
radical  species  may  prevent  the  formation  of  a  dehydrogenated,  graphitized  layer120.  
Interestingly, Figure 8.29 shows for a 50 mT, 25 W Ar plasma, the estimated mass loss (from 
FTIR measurements) is much greater than the mass loss for samples processed in 50 mT, 190 W 
and 10 mT 70 W Ar plasmas, all with 120 eV ions. THF dips of the PR samples for this 50 mT, 
25 W condition show no formation of a graphitized layer and the surface morphology remains 
smooth (Figure 8.30). It is possible that the rate of mass loss is greater than the rate of formation 
of the graphitized layer. 
 
The occurrence of enhanced surface roughening in 193 nm PR, however, appears to 
necessitate a PI ratio between 0.1 and 0.7. As demonstrated earlier, a VUV-only flux (PI = ∞) 
yields  a  smooth  surface  structure.  Similarly  early  studies  of  ion-only  exposures  (PI  =  0) 
conducted in the vacuum beam system demonstrated roughening notably less than simultaneous 
ion and VUV exposure6,62.   In order to generate enhanced roughening of 193 nm PR samples in 
the vacuum beam system, PI ratios were maintained between 0.1 and 0.7. Specifically, ratios of 
0.66, 0.37, and 0.19 were utilized for the conditions investigated in Table 8.2, all of which 
clearly demonstrated roughening of PR surfaces.

8.5.3.4 Temperature Effects 
 
The effect of temperature on 193 nm PR roughening was controlled by adjusting the sample 
holder temperature via a water-bath for constant ion and VUV fluence.  All samples were 
attached to the sample holder with thermal paste to ensure good thermal contact.  To monitor 
temperature control, sample temperatures in the ICP chamber were measured with Omega Four-
Point irreversible temperature indicators attached to the sample. Temperature stickers indicated 
temperatures reached set-point values within 1 – 2 °C for plasma-off conditions. For sample 
temperatures greater than 50 °C, plasma-on conditions increased the sample temperature by ~ 
10 °C for long time (5 min.) and high power exposures. This heating is attributed to ion 
bombardment33,121. 
 
FTIR absorption spectra (Figure 8.31) of 193 nm PR samples processed in the vacuum 
beam and ICP systems under identical VUV and ion fluences demonstrate that bulk modification 
is independent of temperature. AFM measurements, however, indicate surface roughness and 
morphology is sensitive to substrate temperature conditions.  Figure 8.32 displays the RMS 
roughness values for 193 nm PR as a function of temperature for Ar-ICP experiments (Table 8.1, 
condition 2), and Ar VUV plus Ar+ (Table 8.2, condition 4), and Xe VUV plus Ar+ (Table 8.2, 
condition  5)  vacuum  beam  exposures.    As  the  temperature  is  increased,  there  is  a  nearly 
monotonic increase in RMS roughness.  The total RMS roughness for samples processed in the 
vacuum beam system is comparatively smaller due to a slightly decreased exposure fluence.

otherwise noted. 
111
The physical characteristics of 193 nm PR roughness (i.e. grain-size and shape) are 
similar in both vacuum beam and ICP systems. Figure 8.33 displays the AFM images for 
samples processed at various temperatures in the ICP and vacuum beam systems. At 20 °C and  
40 °C, the feature size is small and roughness ranges from 1.5 – 2.5 nm. Samples processed in 
the vacuum beam system (e and f) are exposed to Xe VUV photons at 3.7 × 1017 cm-2 vs. Ar 
VUV photons in the ICP system (a and b) at 8 – 9 × 1017 cm-2. Due to the larger VUV fluence in 
the  ICP  system,  the  resulting  features  are  less  pebble-like  and  more  “yarn-like.”    As  the 
temperature is increased to 65 °C and 100 °C, the roughening continues. In both beam (h, Ar 
OAR source) and plasma (d) results, the roughness produces similar “yarn-like” features on the 
same scale ~ 9 – 10 nm. 
 
Increasing substrate temperature may contribute to the compressive stresses generated in 
the ion and VUV modified layers. Measurements have shown that the T  values of VUV-
g
scissioned PRs decrease with VUV fluence8,11.  Simultaneously, due to ion bombardment of the 
surface  layer,  the  top  ~2  nm  is  dehydrogenated  and  highly  graphitized99,109,  therefore 
contributing to an increased T . The combination of a top surface region in compressive stress 
g
and an underlying layer with a greater tendency to relax may lead to the wrinkled surfaces 
described as enhanced PR roughening. 
 
 
8.5.4   Wrinkling Mechanism 
 
The results above demonstrate the experimental conditions necessary to initiate PR roughening 
and provides some insight to a possible roughening mechanism.  The exact mechanism still 
requires  further  investigation  since  mechanical  properties  of  the  processed  PRs  must  be 
measured and complex plasma systems still require study. Thus far, however, experimental and 
MD results demonstrate the formation of an ion modified graphitized layer, ~ 2 nm thick, with 
increased  T ,  density,  and  viscosity  above  a  thick  (~100  nm)  VUV-scissioned  layer  with 
g
decreased T , density, and viscosity. Given the significant difference in the resulting mechanical 
g
properties of each layer, wrinkling may occur to relieve the intrinsic stress that develops within 
the top graphitized layer due to ion bombardment116-118.  
 
The formation of this bilayer system with differing mechanical properties may be the 
cause, or at least the initiation, of polymer wrinkling.  For example, unlike 193 nm PR, 248 nm 
PR  demonstrates  little  roughening  when  exposed  to  similar  VUV  photon  and  ion  fluence 
conditions. The 248 nm PR will form the same ion-induced surface graphitized (cross-linked) 
layer, but the absence of significant C-O bonds in this material precludes the deeper scissioning 
that occurs in 193 nm PR. Rather, the VUV will act to cross-link the 248 nm PR, thus reducing 
the likelihood of surface wrinkles forming. Numerous authors report the formation of wrinkles 
(e.g. herring-bone patterns) for polymer films only in the presence of a top compressively 
stressed layer in a bilayer system in which the underlying layer can deform either elastically or 
viscoelastically122-128. 
 
 
112
8.5.4.1   Compressive Stress Calculations 
 
The minimum compressive stress necessary to initiate wrinkling of 193 nm PR is estimated from 
elastic-viscoelastic  bilayer  systems  used  to  model  thin  metal/polymer  film  systems123,124,129. 
Huang  et  al.123-125  shows  the  critical  condition  for  wrinkling  and  the  extent  of  wrinkling 
(amplitude and wavelength) are dependent on the film and underlayer thicknesses, h and H, 
f
respectively. For thick viscoelastic (i.e. VUV-scissioned) layers (H) and thin films (h), the effect 
f
of H decreases as H/h → ∞.  The experimental conditions studied for 193 nm PR processing 
f
(Ar 10 mT, 70 W, 5 s – 300 s) results in photoabsorption penetration depths of 38 – 90 nm (see 
simulation study in Chapter 7), while the graphitized layer is ~ 2 nm. Therefore analysis of the 
critical condition can be taken in the limit H/h → ∞.   
f
   
The critical stress (σ ), for H/h → ∞ is defined as:

where E, ν, and μ  are the Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio, and relaxation modulus of the film, 
f f 0
respectively, and ν is Poisson’s ratio for the underlying layer. The wrinkling wavelength (L ) and

Mechanical properties of the modified 193 nm PR are estimated from published literature. The 
graphitized layer is approximated as tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C)116,118, while the VUV-
scissioned layer is modeled as poly-methyl methacrylate (PMMA) (Table 8.3). 
 
The critical stress is dependent on the relaxation modulus, which is a function of time. 
However in the limits of the glassy and rubbery cases, the critical stresses are ~ 5 GPa and 11 
MPa, respectively (Table 8.4). For the glassy case, this results in a wrinkling wavelength of ~ 28 
nm and amplitude of ~ 4 nm.  This is in rather good agreement with AFM images (eg. Figure 
8.23 and 8.33) where RMS roughness values are ~3 – 4 nm, and granular/pebble formation is on 
the order of 20 – 40 per 1 μm in length measured.  Additionally, a critical compressive stress 
value  of  5  GPa  for  wrinkling  of  193  nm  PR  is  not  unreasonable  when  experimental  and 
calculated compressive stresses for buckling of plasma-modified polymers are on the order of 15 
– 20 GPa130.   
 
  Experimental results demonstrate there is a clear dynamic dependence on processing time.  
Not only are the thicknesses of each modified layer changing with time (due to etching and 
113
photoabsorption), but the mechanical properties and compressive stresses are changing as well. 
Assuming constant E, the growth of the winkling amplitude can be found as a function of σ  and 
f 0
μ  (Figure  8.34),  i.e.  as  a  function  of  processing  time.    Short  time  vacuum  beam  system 
measurements are normalized to the results, demonstrating the lag between the initial exposure 
time (at 0 s) and initial onset of PR wrinkling (5 min) may be due to the time dependent change 
in μ and growth of σ .  Clearly, a deeper understanding of the material mechanical properties is 
0
required.

8.5.4.2   Temperature Considerations 
 
Experimental results clearly demonstrate that the magnitude of PR roughening is temperature 
dependent and may possibly reflect some changes in the mechanical properties of the PR and the 
mismatch  between  sandwiched  layers.  Table  8.5  summarizes  how  physical  and  chemical 
modifications to pure PMMA (e.g. cross-linking, scissioning, etching) will affect some thermo-
mechanical properties.  
 
The stresses induced by thermal mismatch between the graphitized – VUV scissioned – 
pristine PR tri-layer were considered by calculating the induced stress from each layer and 
summing them by the principle of superposition131. The flexural stress in layer “a” with respect 
to “b” and “b” with respect to “a” is calculated as follows: 
 
E (α −α )ΔT ⎡ ⎛t ⎞ ⎛t ⎞2 E t ⎛1−ν ⎞⎤
 σ = − a b a ⎢3⎜ a ⎟+2⎜ a ⎟ − b b ⎜ a ⎟⎥         (8.4)

b (1−ν )K ⎢ ⎜⎝t ⎟⎠ E ⎜⎝t ⎟⎠ ⎜⎝1−ν ⎟⎠⎥
b ⎣ b b a a ⎦
 
where K is define as:

⎛t ⎞ ⎛t ⎞ E ⎛t ⎞ ⎛1−ν ⎞ E ⎛t ⎞⎛1−ν ⎞

t t E t 1−ν E t 1−ν
⎝ ⎠ ⎝ ⎠ ⎝ ⎠ ⎝ ⎠ ⎝ ⎠⎝ ⎠
b b b a a b b b
 
The variables t, ν, α, and E are the layer thickness, Poisson’s ratio, coefficient of thermal 
expansion and Young’s modulus, respectively. 
 
Assuming, however, the mechanical properties are temperature independent, the induced 
stresses for ΔT = 25 °C (i.e. 50 °C experimental condition) are calculated. Because α values for 
the graphitized and scissioned layers were unknown, estimated values were used based on pure 
PMMA (6 × 10-5 K-1).  With these approximations (α  = 8 × 10-5 K-1), a compressive stress 
scissioned
of ~ 20 MPa is generated in the graphitized layer by the thermal mismatch with the VUV-
scissioned  layer.  Although  this  compressive  stress  <<  critical  compressive  stress  (5  GPa), 
calculations  assume  the  mechanical  properties  are  not  varying  with  time.    As  previously 
examined, the dynamic time dependency of the mechanical properties must be considered, which 
is now further complicated by its dependency on temperature.

8.5.5   Patterned 193 nm Photoresist Samples 
 
193 nm PR patterned samples were processed in the ICP system under experimental conditions 
similar to the blanket PR studies (Table 8.1). The effects of VUV photons (plasma cure), fluence, 
ion energy and temperature on LWR were measured with SEM and compared to RMS surface 
roughness  measurements.  Analysis  of  line-segments  varying  in  length  (40  nm  –  540  nm) 
provided low and high frequency LWR values.  
 
   
8.5.5.1   Plasma Cure Treatment 
 
Treatment of patterned samples in the plasma cure condition (Ar 10 mT, 70 W, 50 °C, zero-bias) 
is consistent with the previous blanket PR studies and with cure processes studied by other 
groups7,11. All PR samples demonstrate a smoothing of the PR surface and LWR with increasing 
exposure time. The smoothing of the PR sample surface correlates well with the decrease in both 
low  and  high  frequency  LWR,  indicating  that  the  VUV  photons  are  likely  responsible  for 
smoothing the PR (Figure 8.35).  Typically the observed low frequency LWR is greater than the 
high frequency LWR by several nm.  As exposure time increases, the difference between low 
and high frequency LWR decreases from 4 nm (at 4 s) to 2 nm (at 270 s) (Figure 8.36).

8.5.5.2   Synergistic VUV Photon and Ion Effects 
 
The synergistic effects of high energy ion and VUV photon irradiation on LWR is observed on 
the patterned samples by biasing the sample holder. Patterned samples receive 110 eV ions in a 
10 mT, 70 W, Ar plasma (Table 8.1, condition 2). Unlike the previous blanket sample studies, it 
appears that both LWR and surface roughness decreases with exposure time and begins to 
increase only after ~ 200 s (Figure 8.37). This apparent discrepancy may be explained by the use 
of 110 eV ions, which is close to the threshold energy (70 eV) (Figure 8.38).   Control blanket 
samples processed with the 110 eV ions show  a similar delay in generating enhanced PR 
roughness. Additionally, the initial decrease in LWR and surface roughness may be due to the 
pre-existing roughness of the patterned PR. It is possible that the mechanical properties of the 
film have been previously altered with prior photolithography steps or the initial roughness may 
influence how the compressive stress in the graphitized layer accumulates with time.  
   
Both high and low frequency LWR correlate well with surface roughness as a function of 
ion energy (Figure 8.39).  At ion energies below the 70 eV threshold, both LWR and surface 
roughness smooth and is consistent with the plasma cure conditions. The difference between 
high and low frequency LWR is also minimized to ~ 2 nm (Figure 8.40).  Above 70 eV, both 
LWR and surface roughness increase. Beyond 200 eV, however, surface roughness tends to stop 
and  is  similar  to  the  observations  made  in  the  blanket  sample  studies.  In  contrast,  LWR 
significantly increases indicating that the roughness may depend on the geometry and resulting 
boundary conditions imposed on the compressively stressed layer.  Additionally, at these higher 
energies, the difference between low and high frequency LWR is increasing, up to ~ 5 nm. 
Representative SEM and AFM images are shown in Figures 8.41 and 8.42.

8.5.5.3   Temperature Effects 
 
SEM  analysis  demonstrates  that  both  high  and  low  frequency  LWR  are  independent  of 
temperatures ranging 20 °C to 80 °C for samples processed in a 10 mT, 70 W Ar plasma with 
110 eV ions for 270 s (Figure 8.43).   The difference (~ 2 nm) in high and low frequency LWR is 
generally small for T < 80 °C.  Only for T > 80 °C is there an acute dependence of LWR on 
temperature while the difference between high and low frequency LWR increases to ~ 5 nm. 
This is in contrast to the surface roughness measurements of the patterned samples where surface 
roughness increases linearly with temperature and is consistent with previously observed blanket 
PR studies. Further analysis will be required to understand why surface roughness and LWR 
dependence on temperature appear unrelated.  Representative SEM and AFM images are shown 
in Figure 8.44.

8.6   Conclusions 
 
Blanket 193 nm PR samples were processed in an ultra-high vacuum beam and ICP systems. 
Samples exposed to VUV-only or simultaneous VUV-photon and ion fluxes were analyzed with 
FTIR spectroscopy and AFM.  The ion energy, photon flux, ion flux and sample temperature 
were controlled and measured. In addition, patterned 193 nm PR samples were processed in the 
ICP system under similar experimental conditions to study effects of process control variables on 
LWR development. 
 
Under Xe-line VUV, and Ar-lamp VUV in the vacuum beam systems and Ar VUV (16 
eV plasma potential ions) in the ICP system, 193 nm PR did not roughen. RMS roughness values 
were near the unprocessed blanket sample ~ 0.3 nm.  A significant amount of C=O lactone and 
ester loss (40 – 60 %) was observed with FTIR analysis under both processing conditions. This 
loss was attributed to the scissioning of CO bonds due to penetrating VUV photons, ~ 100 nm 
deep. The difference in FTIR absorption spectra of vacuum beam (Xe – photons) and ICP (Ar – 
photons) VUV-only exposed samples were attributed to the difference in photon wavelengths 
and resulting photochemistry.  Significant etching did not occur, interpreted with minimal – to – 
no CH /CH  decrease in FTIR spectra.

Blanket  samples  simultaneously  exposed  to  high  energy  ions  and  VUV  photons 
significantly roughened.  As the VUV fluence (and ion fluence) was increased, an increased 
roughening was observed in both the vacuum beam and ICP processed samples, up to ~ 4 nm for 
8 × 1017 photons/cm2.  FTIR analysis, however, showed that samples processed in the beam 
system  did  not  etch  significantly  while  samples  in  the  ICP  system  experienced  significant 
etching. The etching in the ICP system is attributed to the C-, O-, and H-based ions generated 
from gaseous products and residual chamber contamination, although less than 0.7 % of the total 
positive ion fraction.  The reactive species present in the ICP system contributed to the increased 
etch rate; however, it did not change the roughening behavior or structure of the surface layer, 
transitioning from a smooth, to pebble-like, and ultimately yarn-like network.  This demonstrates 
that the addition of trace amount of reactive chemistry significantly changes the plasma behavior, 
thus complicating the study of 193 nm PR in an inert plasma. Therefore, vacuum beam-based 
studies can be viewed as useful tools that can deconvolute and simplify an otherwise complex, 
reactive system. 
 
The formation of surface roughness is correlated to the ion energy and formation of an 
ion-induced graphitized layer. For ion energies < 65 eV, the PR remains smooth with roughness 
levels equivalent to its pristine state and a graphitized layer does not form. As the ion energy is 
increase to 65 eV, a graphitized layer is produced on the top 2 nm of the PR and the surface 
begins to roughen. Increased roughening and formation of a graphitized layer is observed until 
~150 eV. For energies > 150 eV, the rate of roughening declines slightly. This roughening 
behavior is attributed to the intrinsic stress developed in the graphitized layer that is a function of 
the bombarding ion energy, coupled with the lower layer relaxing.  
 
193 nm PR roughness studies demonstrated a dependence on substrate temperature and 
photon-to-ion flux (PI) ratios.  The PI ratio is dependent upon the power and pressure of the 
generated plasma. In order to produce surface roughness with RMS > 1 nm, a PI ratio ranging 
124
from 0.1 to 0.7 must be present. As the temperature of the samples were increased, the surface 
roughness increased, up to RMS values of ~10 nm for 100 °C substrate temperature in both 
vacuum beam and ICP systems.  The monotonic increase in surface roughness for constant VUV 
and ion fluences is attributed to the changing mechanical properties of the irradiated polymer.  
As the surface layer is bombarded with high energy ions, the top 2 nm becomes dehydrogenated 
and heavily graphitized, thus increasing the T  value. In contrast, the VUV photons penetrate the 
g
PR and scission the CO bonds, causing a decrease in T  values.  
g
 
The necessary experimental conditions to produce PR roughening on blanket have been 
identified. Further studies of the mechanical properties of the films will be required to investigate 
the theory of wrinkling for elastic-viscoelastic bilayer systems to determine if the resulting 
changes to the PR during plasma exposures are sufficient in causing the roughening observed.  
 
Lastly, preliminary investigations of patterned 193 nm PR samples in an inert Ar plasma 
demonstrated a correlation between LWR and surface roughness measurements for plasma cure 
and VUV-ion synergy cases. Plasma cures show that LWR and surface roughness decreases with 
VUV fluence and is consistent with blanket PR studies. VUV-ion synergy studies show LWR 
and surface roughness strongly depend on ion energy. A threshold energy of ~ 70 eV must be 
exceeded to see enhanced LWR and surface roughness. However, at energies above 200 eV, 
LWR continues to increase while surface roughness remains unaffected or decreases slightly. 
This may demonstrate how LWR is geometry and boundary condition dependent, but requires 
further study.  Dependence of LWR on temperature is negligible except for temperatures greater 
than 80 °C while surface roughness remains linearly dependent on temperature. Clearly surface 
roughness and LWR are related; however, the exact roughening mechanism still remains unclear. 
Improvement in our understanding would surely benefit from numerical modeling analysis of 
different geometry configurations.

A.4   Radiation Heating Calculation 
 
Wafer  heating  contributions  from  photon  irradiation  was  estimated  using  the  methodology 
presented by Piejak et al.64. The heat flux is calculated according to equation A.4.1.

where Γ  is the photon flux, ε is the excitation energy (Ar* ~ 11.6 eV) and γ is the absorption 
hv
probability (here γ = 1). The photon flux is calculated according to equation A.4.2.

The excited state density is estimated based on the ICP simulation results. At the time of 
this study, only the metastable states (1P  and 3P1) were tracked in the ICP model. As a rough 
1
estimate the generation of resonance states (i.e. photon generating states) was approximated as 
equivalent to the generation of metastable states. Thus five reactions for the generation and 
consumption of Ar* were tracked (see Appendix C), and the excited state density was estimated:

The heat flux due to photon irradiation was ~ 1 W/m2 for estimated photon fluxes on the 
order of 1012 cm-2 s-1and was therefore considered negligible.  Note, if this approximated flux is 
compared to later work studying VUV emissions, the photon flux is most likely an underestimate 
by a few orders of magnitude. For a 50 mT, Ar plasma, the experimentally measured VUV flux 
is ~ 1015 cm-2 s-1; although at higher pressures will likely be less due to radiative trapping and 
quenching.  Based on this experimental VUV flux, the equivalent heat flux to the wafer surface 
is ~ 18 W/m2. With this consideration, the heat flux is at most ~ 3 % of the total heat flux and 
still considered a negligible heat source.

A.5   Evolution of Wafer Temperature in Pulsed Plasmas 
 
The 3D numerical model of the sensor wafer can be utilized to monitor the temperature evolution 
of the wafer for pulsed plasma conditions, i.e. plasma on – off – on. Figure A.5.1 – A.5.2 
demonstrates the model fitted to the PlasmaTempTM temperature rise for exposure to an Ar 
plasma at 70 mT, 80 W, 0.65 mA/cm2.  The lag between model and experiment (few seconds) is 
primarily  due  to  the  PlasmaTempTM  data  acquisition  software.  There  is  an  inherent  delay 
between software initiation and communication with the hardware, making it difficult to define t 
= 0 s. In addition, due to simplifications and assumptions the model may not entirely account for 
the thermal lag of the complex 3D sensor wafer.

The total heat flux to the wafer and module surface is defined by the variable qtot and is 
the sum of three terms: the ion/metastable heat flux (qion1), the thermal conduction heat flux 
(qcond1), and the O-atom recombination heat flux (qrc1). The heat flux expressions are defined 
below for reference. Recall, that n is the ion density, u  is the Bohm velocity, k is the neutral gas 
i B
thermal conductivity, λ is the neutral gas mean free path, and T  is the neutral gas temperature, 
g
all of which are a function of chamber radius. Note in the model, qion1 = q
Ar/O2.

Since heat flux is dependent on the spatial variation of the ion and neutral species, i.e. qtot(r), it 
is necessary to use the numerical simulation of the ICP chamber to obtain n(r), u (r), k(r),  λ(r), 
i B
and T (r). As discussed in Chapter 4, the ICP model simulation is adjusted (through the applied 
g
source power) until the simulation wall ion current is equivalent to the experimentally measured 
ion current. This normalizes the experiment to model. Tables A.6.4 and A.6.5 list the required 
ICP simulation power to achieve wall ion currents equivalent to experiment. In general, the 
required power for a given wall ion current in a pure Ar plasma can be estimated via a linear 
relationship (Figure A.6.1). The ion current in the Ar/O  case, however, does not scale linearly 
2
with power and requires a trial and error approach to obtain the desired wall ion current. The 
simulated n(r), u (r), k(r), λ(r), and T (r) profiles above the wafer surface are fitted with forth-
i B g
order polynomial expressions (e.g. k1, mfp1, t1) that are used to calculate the total heat flux to 
the wafer surface.

B.2   Sheath Simulation – Current Profiles 
 
The displacement, ion and electron current profiles for the 1D sheath domain are plotted in 
Figure B.2.1.  The profiles are generated for a 10 mT, Ar plasma for a low (I  = 0.2 A) and high 
rf
(I  = 1.0 A) bias voltage application.  In both cases, electrons are repelled from the electrode 
rf
surface, x = 0.0020 m, and the electron current is nearly zero.  The total current in the sheath to 
the wafer surface is the sum of the displacement and ion currents.

B.3   Sheath Simulation – Sheath Thickness vs. Ion Mean Free Path 
 
The  sheath  thickness  oscillates  during  the  RF-cycle  as  demonstrated  in  Chapter  5.  It  was 
assumed the ion species traverse the sheath with little–to–no collisions during expansion and 
contraction of the sheath. Plotting the instantaneous sheath thickness vs. the ion mean free path 
demonstrates that under low pressure conditions (< 10 mT), the sheath is collisionless. As the 
pressure increases (~ 20 mT), the sheath becomes collisional during the expansion phase.  For 
pressures  >  50  mT,  the  sheath  grows  increasingly  collisional  during  both  expansion  and 
contraction phases.

B.4   Sheath Simulation – User Guide 
 
This section provides a guide to running the 1D sheath simulation in COMSOLTM and describes 
the steps necessary to achieve fast convergence. Note, the outlined steps are for the RF-current 
driven electrode simulation (not the voltage driven simulation).  
 
There are two approaches that may be taken when using the sheath simulation and the 
approach depends on what input parameters are being changed.  If only the RF-current, I , is 
rf
being changed, then the user may start with a previously solved transient-state simulation. The 
1D sheath models, used for a number of Ar plasma experimental conditions explored in Chapter 
5, are listed in Tables B.4.1 and B.4.2. For users wishing to explore, similar conditions, it is 
recommended to start with one of these converged transient solution simulations. If however, a 
new plasma condition is being explored, i.e. new T  and n , (here n  = n ), then the user should 
e p p es
start with a steady-state simulation, labeled as “1D Sheath Model Startup”. Once the steady-state 
model is solved with the desired T  and n  values, then the transient solution can be obtained for 
e p
a desired bias voltage.

For a new plasma condition, i.e. new T  and n , the following steps are recommended: 
e p
 
1.  Open the start-up model: “1D Sheath Model Startup”. The start-up model is a steady-state, 
high voltage sheath model.  
 
2.  Adjust the domain length such that the solution will converge quickly. Domain length is 
dependent on the plasma/sheath interface density. Between 5 – 10 mm is recommended. 
 
3.   Change plasma/sheath interface density (n ) defined in the “Constants” dialog box. 
p
 
4.   Change electron temperature (T ) defined in the “Constants” dialog box. 
e
 
5.   Change pressure (P) defined in the “Constants” dialog box. 
 
6.   Change electrode voltage (V ). For n  ~ 1016 m-3 then V  ~ 100 V. For n  ~ 1015 m-3 then V  
e p e p e
~50 V. 
 
7.   Run model; this quickly produces a converged solution under the desired plasma conditions 
and generates initial conditions for the transient state model. 
 
8.   Change Solver Parameter to “Transient” state, and input desired number of cycles. Start with 
10 cycles for quick convergence.  
 
9.   Change the BC for Poisson’s equation: Input the rf-current BC  
 
10.  Change  I   current  value  in  “Constants”  dialog  box.  Make  sure  I   is  small  for  quick 
rf rf
convergence. Slowly increase I  until the desired V  (at electrode) value is obtained. The 
rf pp
simulation will typically fail to converge if the I  increments were too large.

Note: It is possible to update a previously converged transient simulation (with the RF-current 
BC) with new n  and T  values as long as Δn  and ΔT  are small. If the values are too large, 
p e p e
instabilities will arise and the simulation may fail to converge, or several hundred cycles must be 
run to remove the instability.

B.5   Sheath Simulation – Ion Energy Distribution Function 
 
The ion energy distribution (IED) is an important parameter that affects surface reactions and 
film etching rates. The ion bombarding energy over the wafer surface is determined by the 
spatial and temporal evolution of the electric fields within the expanding and collapsing sheath. 
As the applied RF-bias voltage increases, the oscillations of the sheath potential increases, 
resulting in a larger fraction of time spent at large negative potentials while the time the potential 
 
is pinned at the floating potential decreases. Simultaneously, the sheath thickness increases with 
RF-bias voltage. Ions entering a thick sheath near the plasma potential, will not be accelerated to 
high enough velocities to traverse the sheath. Consequently, the ions will remain in the sheath 
when the potential becomes increasingly negative. As a result, ions are accelerated by a larger 
electric field and will bombard the wafer with larger energies2,87,90.  Ions entering thin sheaths, 
however, will traverse the sheath with high enough velocity and will strike the wafer with 
energies near the plasma potential. This dynamic behavior will typically produce bimodal IEDs. 
Experimentally, the IED can be measured with gridded ion energy analyzers88,90.  The IED, 
however, can also be predicted with a self-consistent sheath model.  The numerical sheath model 
provides profiles for the spatially varying potential drop, ion velocity and charge densities as a 
function of various RF-bias voltages (I ) and plasma densities (n ).   With values for the ion flux 
rf es
(nu) and ion kinetic energy gained (assuming it is equivalent to the sheath potential drop (Φ)) at 
i i
every  instant  in  the  RF-cycle,  the  IED  can  be  calculated.    A  MATLABTM  script 
(IEDF_calculations.m) was written to calculate the IED for experimental conditions investigated 
in the PlasmaVoltTM study. The script determines the number of times an ion bombards the 
electrode surface with a specific energy. 
 
Figure B.5.1 shows the potential drop for a 20 mT, 75 W Ar plasma (n  = 1.74 x 1010 cm-
p
3, T  = 3.0 eV) for varying bias voltages (i.e. I  is varied). As the bias voltage is increased, the 
e rf
sheath potential increases and the time the potential is pinned at the floating potential (~ 9 eV) 
decreases.  This trend is observed in the IED (Figure B.5.2).  The low energy peak position is ~ 
constant ( 9 eV) because the voltage waveform is pinned near the floating potential. As the bias 
voltage is increased, ions in the low energy peak shift toward the high energy peak due to the 
expanding sheath. The high energy peak increases linearly with the bias power (Figure B.5.3) 
and agrees well with the IED simulation studies of Edelberg90.

C.1   Introduction 
 
This  appendix  contains  documentation  for  the  inductively  coupled  plasma  (ICP)  numerical 
model utilized in the PlasmaTempTM, PlasmaVoltTM, and VUV studies presented in Chapters 4 – 
8. The numerical model was originally developed in FemlabTM, a commercial software now 
called  COMSOLTM,  by  previous  graduate  student  Cheng-Che  Hsu.  The  2-dimensional, 
axisymmetric model was designed to represent the experimental ICP system and to study Ar, 
Ar/O , and Ar/O /Cl  plasma characteristics.  For the purpose of this dissertation, the ICP model 
2 2 2
was modified for three specific intentions: 
 
1.  Model the flux of Ar-metastables:  In the PlasmaTempTM study, the effect of Ar-
metastables (Arm) on wafer heating was investigated. The flux of Arm could not 
be experimentally measured and was therefore necessary to estimate with the 
model. The original ICP model did not track the generation or consumption of 
Arm species. 
 
2.  Account for the thermal properties of Ar/O  mixed plasmas: The PlasmaTempTM 
2
study also investigated the heat flux contributions from the neutral gas species in 
Ar/O  plasmas. In the first version of the model, the physical properties (e.g. 
2
thermal conductivity, heat capacity, viscosity, etc.) of the neutral gas species were 
a function of Ar only.  
 
3.  Model vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) emissions:  The degree of VUV photon spatial 
variation  in  the  ICP  chamber  and  the  effects  of  power  and  pressure  were 
investigated in the 193 nm PR studies. Experimental measurements with the VUV 
spectrometer provided line-of-sight measurements from which spatial variation 
could not be determined.  Therefore a model of Ar-resonance state generation in 
the ICP chamber would provide information about VUV emissions. The original 
ICP model did not track the generation or consumption of Ar-resonance states. 
 
A detailed discussion of the original ICP model and comparison to experiment, is found 
in the dissertation of Hsu48.  The model structure, language, and interfacing capabilities with 
MATLABTM are also provided in his work and will not be reviewed here. 
 
Emphasis will be placed on the additions, modifications, and resulting changes to the 
modeled plasma characteristics.  Two updated working models will be presented. The first 
updated  ICP  model  (called  ArM)  utilized  in  the  PlasmaTempTM  studies  will  demonstrate 
modification of the physical properties (k, C , ρ) of the neutral species and incorporation of Arm 
v
(section C.2).  The second updated model (called ArMSR) used in the VUV studies will show 
the addition of Ar-resonance states (section C.3). 
 
148
C.2   ICP Model Set-up: Domains and Boundaries 
 
The ICP simulation is a fluid model, solving a series of partial differential equations coupling Ar, 
Ar/O  and Ar/O /Cl  neutral chemistry and transport to plasma characteristics.  The model is a 
2 2 2
2D axisymmetric representation of the ICP chamber (r = 10 cm, h = 10 cm) and consists of 11 
domains (Figure C.1). Processing gas enters the top annular region (subdomain 11) and exits 
through the lower radial annulus (subdomain 9). Power is deposited through the top 5-turn coil 
(subdomains  4  –  8)  through  the  dielectric  window  (subdomain  2).  Capacitive  coupling  is 
minimized with a Faraday shield in experimental practice and therefore capacitive effects are 
excluded in the model. All walls, including the lower electrode are grounded. 
 
The ICP model solves for the neutral gas flow (u, v), temperature (T), pressure (p), and 
neutral specie densities (w).  The deposited ICP power for electron excitation (E ) and electron 
i θ
power balance (T ) is also solved. Positively and negatively charged ion species (n) are also 
e i
solved and electron density (n ) is determined by the difference between the sum of all positive 
e
and negative ions. The complete derivation, simplifications, and assumptions of each model 
equation are given in the dissertation of Hsu in addition to the model nomenclature, constants, 
and scalar expression definitions.

C.3   ArM ICP Model: 
 
C.3.1   Including Ar-Metastable (Arm) Species 
 
The generation and consumption of the Ar-metastable specie (Arm) were tracked in the updated 
ICP model with the reaction expressions listed in Table C.3.1. Electron – excitation reactions 
account  for  Arm  generation;  these  expressions  were  part  of  original  model  to  account  for 
consumption/loss of neutral Ar species. The model was updated with Arm loss mechanisms such 
as metastable pooling, neutral quenching, electron quenching, stepwise ionization and surface 
quenching139-143.  
 
The Arm density (ng1m) was modeled with a neutral species balance, similar to the Ar, O , 
2
and O neutral specie balances48. In COMSOLTM the mass fraction of Arm (w1m) is written 
according to Equation C.3.1.

u is the neutral specie r-momentum, v is the neutral specie z-momentum, and D1m is the Arm 
diffusion rate.   r and r1m are the Ar and Arm source terms (creation minus loss). sumJr and 
sumJz arise in the derivation of the neutral species balance and are defined in Appendix D.

The thermal properties of the original model are a function of the Ar neutral gas specie only. To 
determine the temperature effects on a wafer for a mixed Ar/O  plasma (as in the PlasmaTempTM

study), the thermal properties were redefined for a neutral gas mixture. The constant volume heat

C.3.3   Arm Simulation Results 
 
The ArM ICP simulation results were compared to the work by Kiehlbauch81 for a 40 mT, 80 W 
Ar  plasma.  Arm  generated  profiles  qualitatively  and  near-quantitatively  agree  with  his 
dissertation work.  The metastable species are generated by electron impact excitation from the 
ground state, near the power coils where electron temperature peaks (Figure C.3.1) while Arm is 
depleted due to neutral gas heating electron and surface quenching81.  Due to electron kinetics 
and neutral transport, the net gas phase source term for Arm is zero near the center of the reactor 
and is positive near surfaces81(Figure C.3.2). 
 
The peak Arm density is ~ 1.4 × 1011 cm-3 and the volume averaged density is ~ 5.4 × 1011 
cm-3.  The peak Arm mole fraction is ~1.34 × 10-4.  The peak neutral gas temperature is ~ 437 K. 
The Arm density calculated by Kiehlbauch81 is 1.1 × 1011 cm-3 for his 40 mT, 80 W Ar plasma 
simulation. The volume averaged Arm mole fraction is 1.5 × 10-4 and the peak neutral gas 
temperature is ~ 680 K.  
 
The addition of the new Arm specie does not significantly alter previously established 
trends and values (in the original ICP model) for ion and electron density profiles, and electron 
temperature. The quantitative differences between the ArM simulation and Kiehlbauch’s model 
may be attributed to a number of simplifications and assumptions. For example, the EEDF in 
Kiehlbauch’s model utilizes a parameterized EEDF, whereas the COMSOLTM model employs a 
Maxwellian EEDF.  Certainly there is room for improvement but the general agreement in 
density profiles and values provide a first step approximation for estimating Arm fluxes to 
substrate surfaces

C.4.1   Mass Balance 
 
The original ICP model was again updated with four new continuity equations to track Ar 
metastable (1s  and 1s ) and Ar resonance (1s  and 1s ) state species (Table C.4.1). The 1s levels 
3 5 2 4
are populated from the ground state and upper 1p levels (Figure C.4.1).

electron and Ar atom densities, respectively. The eight generation and loss terms on the right 
side of the equation represent: 
 
(1)  Excitation by electron collisions with ground state Ar atoms. 
(2)  De-excitation to ground state by super-elastic electron collisions 
(3)  Stepwise ionization 
(4)  Conversion between states due to electron collisions 
(5)  Destruction due to collisions between 1s states (e.g. metastable pooling) 
(6)  Radiative decay from 1s  and 1s  to ground states with trapping 
2 4
(7)  Diffusion 
(8)  Neutral quenching 
 
Many numerical models also include generation and loss mechanisms such as Penning 
ionization, and three-body collisions with thermal argon ground state atoms, fast argon ions, fast 
argon atoms, or electrons69,140.  For simplicity, however, these terms were not included because 
they  play  insignificant  roles  in  comparison  to  the  main  populating  and  depopulating 
mechanisms140,144.  The radiative decay term (6) is dropped in the metastable mass balance 
equations and is only included in the resonance state balance equations. A  is defined as the 
eff
product of the Einstein coefficient and escape factor that accounts for radiation trapping64. The 
diffusion and neutral quenching terms (7 and 8) were included only in the metastable balance 
equations. The diffusion term is defined similarly to the Ar atom diffusion coefficient. The 
reaction rate expressions used for each state are defined in Table C.4.2.

C.4.4   ArMSR Simulation Results 
 
Qualitative agreement between ArMSR simulation results and literature is obtained. The general 
dependence of the 1s  – 1s  species on power and pressure will be reviewed here.  
2 5
 
Figure C.4.3 – C.4.5 plots the 3-D density profiles of the 1s  – 1s  species for a 10 mT, 
2 5
200 W Ar plasma. A major source of metastable species is near the rf-coil region where T  is the 
e
greatest: k = k(T ). It follows that due to mixing, resonance species will also have a large density 
e
near the rf-coil region. As the pressure is increased (50 mT, 200 W) plasma density and neutral 
gas temperatures increase resulting in a decrease of 1s  and 1s  species at the chamber center 
3 5
(Figure C.4.6 – C.4.9). The density profiles resemble the caldera-type feature similar to the Ar-
metastable profiles simulated by Kiehlbauch81,141. 1s  and 1s  profiles are more peaked than 1s  
2 4 3
and 1s  profiles due to different production and loss mechanisms; e.g. radiation trapping and 
5
electron collisional excitation, which are radially dependent.

Simulation studies of Ar metastables and resonance states found in literature demonstrate 
that as plasma powers are increased, the 1s  and 1s  profiles broaden and the edge densities tend 
3 5
to increase due to increasing generation and diffusion rates146. This results in a more uniform line 
integrated density. Although not shown here, this behavior is observed in the ArMSR simulation 
results. For a 10 mT, Ar plasma as power is increased from 100 W – 300 W, the overall 1s  
5
density in the system increases from 3.3e17 m-3 to 5.0e17 m-3.  The chamber center to edge 
density variation, however, decreases from ~ 5.5 to ~ 3.5 for the 100 W and 300 W cases, 
respectively. This increase in the edge density results in a more uniform integrated line density.   
 
Comparing the 1s  – 1s  densities at a fixed pressure for varying powers demonstrate that 
2 5
1s  > 1s  > 1s  > 1s  (Figure C.4.10).  For highly excited levels, more energy is required to 
5 4 2 3
produce the same amount of excitation, compared to lower levels. Therefore it is expected that 
1s  (E = 11.548 eV) will have a higher density than the 1s , 1s , and 1s  (E =11.828, 11.723, 
5 2 3 4
11.624 ) states. The same trend holds for fixed power and varying pressures (Figure C.4.11) and 
is in agreement with literature results69,146,147. For the Ar 10 mT case, 1s  density is about three 
5
times greater than the 1s  case. As pressure is increased, the ratio of 1s  to 1s  is ~5 and is in 
3 5 3
good agreement with the statistical weights of both levels (which predict a factor of 5 difference 
in specie density)144.  As observed in the 3D density profiles (cf Figures C.4.6 – C.4.9), as the 
pressure is increased (e.g. 50 ~ 70 mT) the 1s  and 1s  densities begin to decrease due to neutral 
3 5
gas heating effects. In contrast, the 1s  and 1s  densities continuously increase with pressure due 
2 4
to radiation trapping. This is also consistent with the simulation results observed by Hebner69,146 
and Gorchakov147.

from an Ar plasma. The simulated VUV photon flux emitted from the 1s  and 1s  states, however, 
2 4
underestimate the true VUV flux by ~102.  This is likely due to omission of species from other 
Ar manifolds (e.g. 3p54p) that populate 1s  and 1s  states.

The general qualitative agreement, however, suggests the ArMSR ICP model can be a 
useful tool for predicting the behavior of VUV emissions for a given operating condition, 
relative to other plasma characteristics, e.g. ion flux (Figure C.4.14 – C.4.15) or plasma density. 
The ArMSR ICP model values for T, T , are within 2 – 10 % of the original model, while n  and 
e e
ng1m are underestimated by ~1.6-1.7 times. This is expected due to the addition of several new 
reaction terms, which no doubt omits many other resonance and metastable state creation and 
loss mechanisms.

Appendix F: 
TM
Matlab  scripts for the ArM ICP model 
 
The MatlabTM scripts required to run the ArM simulation are provided in this Appendix; they are 
modified from the original ICP model to include the new Ar-metastable specie. Scripts are 
located  in  the  “ICPScripts_ArMetastables”  folder.  The  pdep.m,  pdepdataexchange.m, 
regulargridcoordinates.m, and results.m are original files. Modifications are only made in the 
run_ArO2.m and iter_ArO2 files. See the dissertation of Hsu48 for the user guides.

Matlab  scripts for the ArMSR ICP model 
 
The MatlabTM scripts are modified from the original ICP model to include the 1s , 1s , 1s , and 
2 3 4
1s   species.  Scripts  are  located  in  the  “ICPScripts_ArMSR”  folder.  The  pdep.m, 
5
pdepdataexchange.m, and regulargridcoordinates.m are original files. Modifications are only 
made in the run_ArO2.m, iter_ArO2.m and results.m files. See the dissertation of Hsu48 for the 
user guides.
