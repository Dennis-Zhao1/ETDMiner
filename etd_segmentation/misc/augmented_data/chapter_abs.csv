																																					Abstract
The linear dynamic viscoelastic behavior of free films and lap-shear bonded metal joints
were compared. They investigated thermosetting and thermoplastics. There was a mechanical
dispersion occurring at higher temperatures in the bonds. Sample preparation is an
important part of the evaluation of bonding materials. The role of evaluating proper
material response functions and their connection to joint failure events is one of the
clear roles of a total systems analysis approach to adhesive bonding. The desire to
explore a particular response function, the linear viscoelastic quantity tan 8, was the
motivation for this work. The tan 6 function for 7 is associated with the dispersions of
maxima.

																																					Abstract
The thermal and dynamic mechanical behavior of triblock copolymers with a
styrene/isoprene/styrene architecture were investigated. The thermal and mechanicl
response of films bonding together two titanium alloy plates was dependent on joint
preparation. The presence of residual stresses in thin films which had been cooled while
under high pressure was felt to contribute to the observed phenomena. It's well known that
viscoelastic stress fields are developed in molten polymer. A cooling process may lead to
anisotropic mechanical properties. Studies showing the effects of residual stresses and
impact failure behavior on the structure-property relationships in oriented polymeric
solids point out the possible subtlety of that. The work done in our laboratory shows
anisotropic behavior with respect to 43.

CHAPTER IV APPLICATION OF COMPRESSIVE CREEP COMPLIANCE MASTER CURVES IS A PREDICTIVE TOOL
IN THE EVALUATION OF PRESSURE SENSITIVE ADHESIVES. The property of pressure sensitive tack
is related to initial bond formation with the surface of another material. A criterion for
establishing contact in a phenomenological sense was proposed. The time scale of the
bonding process should be of the order of 10-7 cm2/dyne or larger, according to this
concept. The evaluation of tack on a fundamental and wide ranging level was possible
thanks to the DMA-2 accessory. Over four decades, compressed creep compliance measurements

In order to interpret their performance, surface chemistry and physical characterization
studies were conducted on a series of isoprene block copolymers. The materials produced
included p-tert-butylstyrene and isoprene, p-methylstyrene and isoprene, as well as
styrene and isoprene. Topologies were created using divinyl benzene in the final stage of
the polymerization. A sharp interfacial boundary between microphases does not necessarily
exist in this series of radial block copolymers, and partial mixing of the component
blocks may be possible in the interfacial region between the two microphases. The model
system in this series is an excellent example of microphase separation. The most
intermixed of the three systems was the p-tert-butylstyrene and isoprene.

																																					Abstract
A series of hydrogenated forms of p-tert-butylstyrene and isoprene radial block copolymers
were investigated. The isoprene phase converts the p-tert-butylstyrene and isoprene radial
block into essentially a p-tert-butylstyrene block plus an ethylene propylene alternating.
It is important that this operation converts a pair of block components into a system that
is likely to have a high degree of microphase separation. The series is an excellent model
system to study. The degree of microphase separation was influenced by the degree of
hydrogenation. Consideration was given to the physical properties of the diene originating
segment, having extreme compositions of polyisoprene and an ethylene propylene alternating
as well as a number of partially unsaturated versions. The investigation shows that it was
possible to control tack and holding power.

In the southeastern USA, forage availability in the summer is an important limitation to
the size of herds. Tall-growing, perennial, warm-season grasses that produce 65 to 75% of
their yield in mid-summer may provide needed summer grazing; however, their establishment
is often slow and inconsistent when compared to cool-season species. To make these species
less vulnerable to weed competition, methods are needed. The two tall-growing, perennial,

																																					Abstract
Cool-season perennial grass productivity plummets during hot, dry weather. In the United
States and especially in the Southeast, there has been a summer slump. Perennial, tall-
growing, warm- season forage grasses produce abundant herbage during the summer and could
make a contribution to southeastern systems. The relatively long period required to
produce grazable stands of warm-season grasses is problematic. Problems with establishment
need to be investigated before these warm-season species can be incorporated into a summer
system. Research was done to evaluate the influence of limestone, P, and carbofuran on the
establishment of switchgrass. The killed sod in Blacksburg, VA is located at 610 m
elevation and was planted in 1985 and 1986. The soil was a mixture of clayey and mesic
Typic Fragiuduit. The treatments included placing the seed in the row with the limestone

A combination of basic polyhedral units can be used to model the physical properties of
silicate minerals. They could be modeled as the sum of polyhedral contributions. The
contribution of H2O-FeO(6)-Fe(OH) has been determined by multiple regression. We can use
the data to estimate the AG and AH, of other silicate minerals from a weighted sum of the
contribution of each oxide and hydroxide component. The method outlined here can be used
to estimate the thermodynamic properties of silicate phases which are too complex or
impure to give reliable calorimetric measurements. The minerals used in the model have
associated average residuals of 0.26% and 0.24%. The average difference between the
measured and predicted values of 0.25 for AG for 18 minerals and 0.22 for 20 minerals is
less than the difference between the measured and predicted values of 0.25 for AG for 20

The technique that we developed to estimate AGP of silicate minerals by summing the
contribution of polyhedral components can be extended to predict the free energy of
formation of silicate minerals at higher temperatures. Multiple linear regression was used
to find the contribution of the Al2O3(4) - Al2O3(6) The gi coefficients from this model
can be used to calculate the enthalpy of one mole of each oxide or hydroxide component at

The effect of copper on the activity of the tyrannosaurus rex is studied. Two of the
fungi, Pisolithus tinctorius and Boletinellus merulioides, have naturally brown pigmented
hyphae. The hyphae were developed in the presence of copper. The extracellular tyrosinase
produced by S. pictus was 60 g/g copper. The yellow and black hyphae of Piloderma bicolor
and Cenococcum graniforme were unaffected by copper. The activity of P. tinctorius and S.
granulatus decreased when they were grown under copper stress. The reaction mixture was
activated and repressed by the addition of the polyamines putrescine and spermidine. The
Polyamine content of P. tinctorius and B. merulioides was not altered by the addition of
copper. A decrease in the polyamine content may indicate a change in the permeability of
the cells. Key words are copper and polyamines. Copper can be toxic at relatively low
concentrations, but is essential for normal growth and development. The availability of
copper increases when the pH of the growth medium decreases. The mechanisms of tolerate

The Department of Biology Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Blacksburg
is located in Virginia. The most tolerant of copper were Pisolithus tinctorius and
Boletinellus merulioides. Piloderma bicolor was very tolerant. The copper ion was
deposited outside the cell wall in S. pictus and inside the cell wall in P. tintorius. The
results suggest that there may be differences in growth rates observed on copper amended
media. It is likely incorrect to postulate a single mechanism for metal tolerance and
subsequent improvement of host plant growth in such a diverse group of organisms. Key
words are copper, ultrastructure, tolerance, polysaccharides, cell walls and
ectomycorrhizae. The growth of other organisms is severely restricted by the ability of
some fungi to grow at high levels of copper. A number of mechanisms of copper tolerance
can be found in the fungi. The production and deposition of copper oxalate in the
extracellular hyphal sheath of some wood-rotting fungi is one example. There is a

																																					Abstract
There is an effect of copper on the growth of Pinus densiflora. Host growth at both 0 and
15 g/g copper was improved by Suillus pictus. There was no correlation between growth
under metal stress in pure culture and whether the fungus is an early or late stage
colonizer of the host. Mycorrhizal colonization was decreased by copper, but not by
Pisolithus tinctorius and P. bicolor. There was more branching in the presence of metal if
a fungus caused the host to produce branched mycorrhizal short roots. A decrease in copper
lost from mycorrhizal roots when compared to nonmycorrhizal roots was found in all of the
fungi tested. Mycorrhizal colonization increased root and shoot levels, and the increase
was most noticeable at higher copper levels. The percent of vascular tissue in the trees
was decreased by copper. colonization with P. tinctorius caused copper to be in the shoot.
It was likely that both symbionts were responsible for the formation of the mycorrhizal
association. When two fungi were present on the same host, copper altered the ratio of
short root branching patterns. There are different ways in which heavy metal stress
affects ectomycorrhizal fungi. Colonization of tree roots by aycorrhizal partner can
improve the growth of the tree in metal contaminated soil. When grown in high metal media,
Mycorrhizal Betula can incorporate less zinc and nickel into the aboveground parts of the

The Department of Biology is at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University
Blacksburg. Although it is associated with Fraxinus americana, it has never been proven to
be mycorrhizal. Pinus densiflora, a non host tree, was in- oculated with cultures of B.
merulioides. Shoot weights were not increased by inoculation. Short roots lacked root
hairs and had an internal structure similar to that of anycorrhizal rootlets. The short
roots were surrounded by a loose weft of hyphae. The root weight and branching were
increased in inoculated seedlings. The culture filtrates from the liquid cultures of B.
merulioides and Pisolithus tinctorius were analyzed. Both fungi produced measureable
quantities of indole-3-acetic acid. The results show that IAA is the compound responsible
for the dichotomization in the short roots of P. densiflora. Key words: Boletinellus

																																					Abstract
For a firm to remain competitive, it must allocate its limited financial resources into
areas that will maintain or improve its performance. The adoption of innovative process
technologies in the manufacture of lumber and plywood is one area that always competes for
resources. Adoption's impact on a firm's performance has never been studied. This paper
looks at the importance of adopting innovative processing technologies on a firm's
performance by grouping firms producing softwood lumber and plywood using a hierarchical
clustering technique and then profiling these firms using descriptive statistics. This
technique, using firm controllable strategic variables as clustering criteria, is rarely
used in the forest products industry. Thirty-eight firms, responsible for over 30% of 1987
North American softwood lumber production and over 70% of softwood plywood production,
provided empirical evidence that increased adoption of innovative processing technologies
was linked to superior performance. Companies with high levels of adoption were gaining
market share. Firms with low levels of adoption were losing market share. There was no
correlation between firm size and degree of forward vertical integration. Strong support
for building products firms to allocate resources for the development and adoption of new
and innovative processing technologies is one of the strategic implications of this
research. 81

The parent alkali beam and the crossed thermal beams of the K, Rb, Cs and CC14 have been
measured with respect to the parent alkali beam. The differential cross section is a
function of recoil velocity and cm angle in the center-of-mass coordinate system. The
transformation is carried out directly by selecting a single representative velocity in
each of the parent beams. The other method does not use the c.m. The coefficients
determined by a least-squares fit to the experimental data are represented by a many-term
polynomial in powers of ucose and usine. The cross sections of the two methods agree and
confirm the qualitative interpretation of previous experiments. The results obtained for
stripping the reactions of alkali atoms with halogens show a strong correlation between
the two peaks. As E' increases and K Rb Cs increases, the pattern shifts toward the
forward hemisphere. The results are correlated by a modification of the spectator model

The survival value of different parts of the Redwinged Blackbird was determined by
comparing the factors that affect it in marsh and upland breeding habitats. The hypothesis
that Redwings are being excluded from their optimal niche space is supported by the
results. colony size, breeding density, and synchrony were greater in marsh than upland
habitat. The proportion of active nests that were successful, number of young fledged per
active nest, and number fledged per egg were all measures of nest success. The lower
reproductive success of upland populations was caused by a larger proportion of nest
destruction. The marsh's predation pressure was negatively correlated with the depth of
water beneath the nest, providing an anti-predator barrier that upland populations are
unable to achieve. The swamping effect on local predator populations is a result of the
synchrony and greater density of nesting in the marsh. Growth rates, weight at fledging,
and the number fledged per successful nest were similar in the two habi- tats indicating

																																					Abstract
Redwings in marshes tend to be more active than colonies in upland habitats, but the
duration of their activity is longer in large colonies. The variation in timing is
probably related to the vegetation in the habitat and not the size of the colony. The
Redwings' survival value was reduced due to the presence of a large number of prey in the
colonies studied. In large colonies, the percentage of nests predated was lower. During
the peak of the activity, the percentage of predated nests was lower in most colonies. The
Holling model can be applied to different sized colonies. Colony size is probably limited
by a territorial system that protects adequate resources. Smaller colonies might suffer

Increasing sophistication and precision of experimental tests of relativistic gravitation
theories has led to the need for a detailed. The Parametrized Post-Newtonian formalism
treats the post-Newtonian limit of arbitrary metric theories of gravity in terms of nine
metric parameters, whose values vary from theory to theory. The de- tailed definitions and
equations for the formalism are given, as well as the theoretical and experimental founda-
tions of the PPN formalism. According to some metric theories of gravity, a massive, self-
gravitating body's passive gravitational mass should not be equal to its inertial mass,
but should be an anisotropic tensor which depends on the body's self-gravitational energy.
The PPN formalism's theoretical structure is probed by two theorems. They state that a
metric theory of gravity has post-Newtonian integral conser- vation laws if and only if
its nine PPN parameters have values which satisfy a set of seven constraint equations.

belong to the person. It was printed in the U.S.A. The first in a series of theoretical
papers will discuss the experimental foundations of general relativity. The paper reviews,
modifies, and compares two very different theoretical frameworks. The Dicke framework
doesn\'t take into account the nature of gravity or the gross features of the interaction.
The postulates of the Parametrized Post- Neacionian framework are the two tentative
conclusions. Most of the theories of gravity that are compatible with experiment are
covered by the PPN framework. Future papers in this series will develop the PPN framework
in detail, and use it to analyze a variety of relativistic effects that should be visible
in the solar system during the coming decade. Since 1963, a number of discoveries and
observations have forced Astro- physicists to make general relativity a working tool in
their theoretical model building. It would be naive to think that the very astronomical
phenomena in which rela- tivistic gravity is crucial will provide the answer. The local
behavior of matter and magnetic fields are interwoven with the effects of gravity waves.
There is no hope of getting clean tests of the nature of gravity if they are separated.
The astrophysical enterprise uses the laws of gravity as an input and tries to get out in
for- mation about what the matter and fields are doing. The greatest hopes for clean tests
of gravity lie in space and laboratory technology. The National Science Foundation and the
Office of Naval Research supported the project. Theoretical Frameworks for Testing
Relativistic Gravity is the first paper in the series. The papers in this series will tend
to be theoretical and mathematical, with the exception of the present one. ""Relativistic
Gravity in the Solar System"" will be a companion series. It will look at the nature of
various effects and their prospects for detection in the next few decades. My students and

equivalence principle is violated in Brans-Dicke theory when the two mass differ by a
small isotropic correction. The two results are explained. The work generalizes and agrees
with previous calculations. In Paper I of this series (Thorne and Will 1971), the
theoretical and experimental foundations for metric theories of gravity were described,
and qualitative aspects of the Parametrized Post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism were discussed.
There are postulates that there exists a metric of signature -2 which governs proper
length and proper time measurements, and that the response of stressed matter to gravity
be described by the equation V.T. The covariant derivative with respect to the metric is
V, and the total stress- energy tensor is T. In this paper, a series of metric parameters
will be used to develop the PPN formalism for perfect fluids. The ""Nordtvedt effect"" is a
rela- tivistic gravity problem. The principle of equivalence is violated by theNordtvedt
effect. According to a wide class of metric theories of gravity, different massive bodies
should fall with different accelerations. This means that the body\'s mass is no longer
equal to its weight. If m is the center mass of the body, a is the acceleration of its
center mass, and U is the external (Newtonian) potential, it can be measured by means of a
test. Permission was granted for this reproduced by the copyright owner. Permission is

																																					Abstract
There is a significant range of frequencies for a representative selection of spherical
earth models. Higher Love modes can be excited to the fundamental mode for both shallow
and deep sources under a variety of circum- stances, and thus higher mode interference is
an important factor to be taken into account in the proper interpretation and analysis of
Love waves. Simple theoretical computations reveal the nature of the effect of mode
contamination on measured phase velocities, and biases in the selection and analysis of
surface wave data make it appear likely that fundamental mode Love waves experiencing
higher mode inter-ference will exhibit high apparent phase velocities. It may not be
necessary to use complex or anisotropic models to explain the observations. The effects of
mode interference, as well as knowledge of source parameters, are reproduced with

																																					Abstract
The seismology study of an ocean ridge earthquake swarm in the Gulf of California in 1969
has provided new information. Similar to a foreshock-mainshock-after shock sequence, but
with a ""mainshock"" composed of over 70 events with magnitudes between 4 and 6 and
occurring in a six hour period about a day after swarm activity was initiated. Many events
greater than magnitude 5 continued for over two weeks. All sources are within 10 km of
each other and hypocenters are confined to the upper crust, according to near-source
travel time data. Teleseismic P-delays for rays travelling beneath this ridge may be
interpreted in terms of an upper mantle with compressional velocities five to ten per cent
less than normal mantle to a depth of 200 km. Average apparent stresses for all swarm
events are very similar, show no consistent pattern as a function of time, and are close
to values obtained from other ridges. A large component of normal faulting is shown in the
focal mechanism solution. The nodal planes common to this mecha were reproduced with

																																					Abstract
The basic observation of this study is that seismograms written in southern California
from earthquakes within the northern Gulf of California are different from those of most.
There is a visual difference between the Baja sources and the Gulf seismograms. This is
thought to be a source effect, reflecting the relatively small source dimen- sions and low
seismic moments of the Baja earthquakes. In principle, the differences in the seismograms
could be caused by a near-source or propagation path effect, but the similarity in paths
and the large magnitude of the observed difference argue against this explanation. There
are some North Baja sources with large moments and source dimensions that show that
different seismograms are produced by different sources. Preliminary examination of
seismo- grams from events within southern California suggests the same kinds of regional
variations there. The Northern Baja earthquakes have source dimensions at least a factor
of four smaller and seismic moments, an order of magnitude less than events of similar
local magnitude within Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Permission is

The thermal and dynamic mechanical behavior of triblock copolymers with a
styrene/isoprene/styrene architecture were investigated. The thermal and mechanicl
response of films bonding together two titanium alloy plates was dependent on joint
preparation. The presence of residual stresses in thin films which had been cooled while
under high pressure was felt to contribute to the observed phenomena. It's well known that
viscoelastic stress fields are developed in molten polymer. A cooling process may lead to
anisotropic mechanical properties. Studies showing the effects of residual stresses and
impact failure behavior on the structure-property relationships in oriented polymeric
solids point out the possible subtlety of that. The work done in our laboratory shows

A series of hydrogenated forms of p-tert-butylstyrene and isoprene radial block copolymers
were investigated. The isoprene phase converts the p-tert-butylstyrene and isoprene radial
block into essentially a p-tert-butylstyrene block plus an ethylene propylene alternating.
It is important that this operation converts a pair of block components into a system that
is likely to have a high degree of microphase separation. The series is an excellent model
system to study. The degree of microphase separation was influenced by the degree of
hydrogenation. Consideration was given to the physical properties of the diene originating
segment, having extreme compositions of polyisoprene and an ethylene propylene alternating
as well as a number of partially unsaturated versions. The investigation shows that it was

Cool-season perennial grass productivity plummets during hot, dry weather. In the United
States and especially in the Southeast, there has been a summer slump. Perennial, tall-
growing, warm- season forage grasses produce abundant herbage during the summer and could
make a contribution to southeastern systems. The relatively long period required to
produce grazable stands of warm-season grasses is problematic. Problems with establishment
need to be investigated before these warm-season species can be incorporated into a summer

hyphae. The hyphae were developed in the presence of copper. The extracellular tyrosinase
produced by S. pictus was 60 g/g copper. The yellow and black hyphae of Piloderma bicolor
and Cenococcum graniforme were unaffected by copper. The activity of P. tinctorius and S.
granulatus decreased when they were grown under copper stress. The reaction mixture was
activated and repressed by the addition of the polyamines putrescine and spermidine. The
Polyamine content of P. tinctorius and B. merulioides was not altered by the addition of

subsequent improvement of host plant growth in such a diverse group of organisms. Key
words are copper, ultrastructure, tolerance, polysaccharides, cell walls and
ectomycorrhizae. The growth of other organisms is severely restricted by the ability of
some fungi to grow at high levels of copper. A number of mechanisms of copper tolerance

There is an effect of copper on the growth of Pinus densiflora. Host growth at both 0 and
15 g/g copper was improved by Suillus pictus. There was no correlation between growth
under metal stress in pure culture and whether the fungus is an early or late stage
colonizer of the host. Mycorrhizal colonization was decreased by copper, but not by
Pisolithus tinctorius and P. bicolor. There was more branching in the presence of metal if
a fungus caused the host to produce branched mycorrhizal short roots. A decrease in copper
lost from mycorrhizal roots when compared to nonmycorrhizal roots was found in all of the
fungi tested. Mycorrhizal colonization increased root and shoot levels, and the increase
was most noticeable at higher copper levels. The percent of vascular tissue in the trees
was decreased by copper. colonization with P. tinctorius caused copper to be in the shoot.
It was likely that both symbionts were responsible for the formation of the mycorrhizal
association. When two fungi were present on the same host, copper altered the ratio of
short root branching patterns. There are different ways in which heavy metal stress
affects ectomycorrhizal fungi. Colonization of tree roots by aycorrhizal partner can
improve the growth of the tree in metal contaminated soil. When grown in high metal media,

The crab meal was treated with 15% trichloroacetic acid, 5% HCL, or 10% formic acid. No
minerals were removed when the meal was treated with.1 M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid.
The initial demineralization of samples resulted in degradation and loss of chitin. The
proportions of crab meal and straw were estimated. The values of the chitin were similar
to those obtained with the ADF/deacetylation procedure. When the acid detergent treatment
was used, the overestimation of the chitin content was eliminated. Lignin is found in
plant fiber and is associated with crab shell. The ADF/deacetylation procedure can be used

In 1988 wood products firms responsible for over one third of the structural panel
production and two thirds of the softwood lumber in Canada and the United States were
surveyed to produce an inventory of new processing technologies adopted for each of these
wood products segments. Oriented strandboard and waferboard were included in the
structural panels. The proportion of 1987 production that used each technology was
measured by the Use Intensity index. For different technologies, use intensity ranged from
less than 1% to more than 90%. Multivariate statistical analysis was used to find out
which technologies were compatible with each other. Different directions for forest and
wood science research can be developed with knowledge of these changes in wood processing.
The inventory can be used to explore areas for future technological innovation in the

																																					Abstract
For a firm to remain competitive, it must allocate its limited financial resources into
areas that will maintain or improve its performance. The adoption of innovative process
technologies in the manufacture of lumber and plywood is one area that always competes for
resources. Adoption's impact on a firm's performance has never been studied. This paper
looks at the importance of adopting innovative processing technologies on a firm's
performance by grouping firms producing softwood lumber and plywood using a hierarchical
clustering technique and then profiling these firms using descriptive statistics. This
technique, using firm controllable strategic variables as clustering criteria, is rarely
used in the forest products industry. Thirty-eight firms, responsible for over 30% of 1987
North American softwood lumber production and over 70% of softwood plywood production,
provided empirical evidence that increased adoption of innovative processing technologies
was linked to superior performance. Companies with high levels of adoption were gaining
market share. Firms with low levels of adoption were losing market share. There was no
correlation between firm size and degree of forward vertical integration. Strong support
for building products firms to allocate resources for the development and adoption of new
and innovative processing technologies is one of the strategic implications of this
research. 81

The parent alkali beam and the crossed thermal beams of the K, Rb, Cs and CC14 have been
measured with respect to the parent alkali beam. The differential cross section is a
function of recoil velocity and cm angle in the center-of-mass coordinate system. The
transformation is carried out directly by selecting a single representative velocity in
each of the parent beams. The other method does not use the c.m. The coefficients
determined by a least-squares fit to the experimental data are represented by a many-term
polynomial in powers of ucose and usine. The cross sections of the two methods agree and
confirm the qualitative interpretation of previous experiments. The results obtained for
stripping the reactions of alkali atoms with halogens show a strong correlation between
the two peaks. As E' increases and K Rb Cs increases, the pattern shifts toward the

The survival value of different parts of the Redwinged Blackbird was determined by
comparing the factors that affect it in marsh and upland breeding habitats. The hypothesis
that Redwings are being excluded from their optimal niche space is supported by the

habitat. The proportion of active nests that were successful, number of young fledged per
active nest, and number fledged per egg were all measures of nest success. The lower
reproductive success of upland populations was caused by a larger proportion of nest
destruction. The marsh's predation pressure was negatively correlated with the depth of
water beneath the nest, providing an anti-predator barrier that upland populations are
unable to achieve. The swamping effect on local predator populations is a result of the

Redwings in marshes tend to be more active than colonies in upland habitats, but the
duration of their activity is longer in large colonies. The variation in timing is
probably related to the vegetation in the habitat and not the size of the colony. The
Redwings' survival value was reduced due to the presence of a large number of prey in the
colonies studied. In large colonies, the percentage of nests predated was lower. During
the peak of the activity, the percentage of predated nests was lower in most colonies. The
Holling model can be applied to different sized colonies. Colony size is probably limited

Increasing sophistication and precision of experimental tests of relativistic gravitation
theories has led to the need for a detailed. The Parametrized Post-Newtonian formalism
treats the post-Newtonian limit of arbitrary metric theories of gravity in terms of nine
metric parameters, whose values vary from theory to theory. The de- tailed definitions and
equations for the formalism are given, as well as the theoretical and experimental founda-
tions of the PPN formalism. According to some metric theories of gravity, a massive, self-
gravitating body's passive gravitational mass should not be equal to its inertial mass,
but should be an anisotropic tensor which depends on the body's self-gravitational energy.
The PPN formalism's theoretical structure is probed by two theorems. They state that a
metric theory of gravity has post-Newtonian integral conser- vation laws if and only if
its nine PPN parameters have values which satisfy a set of seven constraint equations.

papers will discuss the experimental foundations of general relativity. The paper reviews,
modifies, and compares two very different theoretical frameworks. The Dicke framework
doesn\'t take into account the nature of gravity or the gross features of the interaction.
The postulates of the Parametrized Post- Neacionian framework are the two tentative
conclusions. Most of the theories of gravity that are compatible with experiment are
covered by the PPN framework. Future papers in this series will develop the PPN framework
in detail, and use it to analyze a variety of relativistic effects that should be visible
in the solar system during the coming decade. Since 1963, a number of discoveries and
observations have forced Astro- physicists to make general relativity a working tool in
their theoretical model building. It would be naive to think that the very astronomical
phenomena in which rela- tivistic gravity is crucial will provide the answer. The local
behavior of matter and magnetic fields are interwoven with the effects of gravity waves.
There is no hope of getting clean tests of the nature of gravity if they are separated.
The astrophysical enterprise uses the laws of gravity as an input and tries to get out in
for- mation about what the matter and fields are doing. The greatest hopes for clean tests
of gravity lie in space and laboratory technology. The National Science Foundation and the
Office of Naval Research supported the project. Theoretical Frameworks for Testing

equivalence principle is violated in Brans-Dicke theory when the two mass differ by a
small isotropic correction. The two results are explained. The work generalizes and agrees
with previous calculations. In Paper I of this series (Thorne and Will 1971), the
theoretical and experimental foundations for metric theories of gravity were described,
and qualitative aspects of the Parametrized Post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism were discussed.
There are postulates that there exists a metric of signature -2 which governs proper
length and proper time measurements, and that the response of stressed matter to gravity
be described by the equation V.T. The covariant derivative with respect to the metric is
V, and the total stress- energy tensor is T. In this paper, a series of metric parameters
will be used to develop the PPN formalism for perfect fluids. The ""Nordtvedt effect"" is a
rela- tivistic gravity problem. The principle of equivalence is violated by theNordtvedt
effect. According to a wide class of metric theories of gravity, different massive bodies
should fall with different accelerations. This means that the body\'s mass is no longer
equal to its weight. If m is the center mass of the body, a is the acceleration of its
center mass, and U is the external (Newtonian) potential, it can be measured by means of a
test. Permission was granted for this reproduced by the copyright owner. Permission is

																																					Abstract
There is a significant range of frequencies for a representative selection of spherical
earth models. Higher Love modes can be excited to the fundamental mode for both shallow
and deep sources under a variety of circum- stances, and thus higher mode interference is
an important factor to be taken into account in the proper interpretation and analysis of
Love waves. Simple theoretical computations reveal the nature of the effect of mode
contamination on measured phase velocities, and biases in the selection and analysis of
surface wave data make it appear likely that fundamental mode Love waves experiencing
higher mode inter-ference will exhibit high apparent phase velocities. It may not be
necessary to use complex or anisotropic models to explain the observations. The effects of
mode interference, as well as knowledge of source parameters, are reproduced with

																																					Abstract
The seismology study of an ocean ridge earthquake swarm in the Gulf of California in 1969
has provided new information. Similar to a foreshock-mainshock-after shock sequence, but
with a ""mainshock"" composed of over 70 events with magnitudes between 4 and 6 and
occurring in a six hour period about a day after swarm activity was initiated. Many events
greater than magnitude 5 continued for over two weeks. All sources are within 10 km of
each other and hypocenters are confined to the upper crust, according to near-source
travel time data. Teleseismic P-delays for rays travelling beneath this ridge may be
interpreted in terms of an upper mantle with compressional velocities five to ten per cent
less than normal mantle to a depth of 200 km. Average apparent stresses for all swarm
events are very similar, show no consistent pattern as a function of time, and are close
to values obtained from other ridges. A large component of normal faulting is shown in the
focal mechanism solution. The nodal planes common to this mecha were reproduced with

																																					Abstract
The basic observation of this study is that seismograms written in southern California
from earthquakes within the northern Gulf of California are different from those of most.
There is a visual difference between the Baja sources and the Gulf seismograms. This is
thought to be a source effect, reflecting the relatively small source dimen- sions and low
seismic moments of the Baja earthquakes. In principle, the differences in the seismograms
could be caused by a near-source or propagation path effect, but the similarity in paths
and the large magnitude of the observed difference argue against this explanation. There
are some North Baja sources with large moments and source dimensions that show that
different seismograms are produced by different sources. Preliminary examination of
seismo- grams from events within southern California suggests the same kinds of regional
variations there. The Northern Baja earthquakes have source dimensions at least a factor
of four smaller and seismic moments, an order of magnitude less than events of similar
local magnitude within Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Permission is

The thermal and dynamic mechanical behavior of triblock copolymers with a
styrene/isoprene/styrene architecture were investigated. The thermal and mechanicl
response of films bonding together two titanium alloy plates was dependent on joint

under high pressure was felt to contribute to the observed phenomena. It's well known that
viscoelastic stress fields are developed in molten polymer. A cooling process may lead to
anisotropic mechanical properties. Studies showing the effects of residual stresses and

A series of hydrogenated forms of p-tert-butylstyrene and isoprene radial block copolymers
were investigated. The isoprene phase converts the p-tert-butylstyrene and isoprene radial
block into essentially a p-tert-butylstyrene block plus an ethylene propylene alternating.
It is important that this operation converts a pair of block components into a system that
is likely to have a high degree of microphase separation. The series is an excellent model
system to study. The degree of microphase separation was influenced by the degree of
hydrogenation. Consideration was given to the physical properties of the diene originating

as well as a number of partially unsaturated versions. The investigation shows that it was

Cool-season perennial grass productivity plummets during hot, dry weather. In the United
States and especially in the Southeast, there has been a summer slump. Perennial, tall-
growing, warm- season forage grasses produce abundant herbage during the summer and could
make a contribution to southeastern systems. The relatively long period required to

need to be investigated before these warm-season species can be incorporated into a summer

There is an effect of copper on the growth of Pinus densiflora. Host growth at both 0 and
15 g/g copper was improved by Suillus pictus. There was no correlation between growth
under metal stress in pure culture and whether the fungus is an early or late stage
colonizer of the host. Mycorrhizal colonization was decreased by copper, but not by
Pisolithus tinctorius and P. bicolor. There was more branching in the presence of metal if
a fungus caused the host to produce branched mycorrhizal short roots. A decrease in copper
lost from mycorrhizal roots when compared to nonmycorrhizal roots was found in all of the
fungi tested. Mycorrhizal colonization increased root and shoot levels, and the increase
was most noticeable at higher copper levels. The percent of vascular tissue in the trees
was decreased by copper. colonization with P. tinctorius caused copper to be in the shoot.
It was likely that both symbionts were responsible for the formation of the mycorrhizal
association. When two fungi were present on the same host, copper altered the ratio of
short root branching patterns. There are different ways in which heavy metal stress
affects ectomycorrhizal fungi. Colonization of tree roots by aycorrhizal partner can

hairs and had an internal structure similar to that of anycorrhizal rootlets. The short
roots were surrounded by a loose weft of hyphae. The root weight and branching were
increased in inoculated seedlings. The culture filtrates from the liquid cultures of B.

																																					Abstract
The value of certain chemicals to retard the decline of crab processing waste was studied
in four experiments. Pre- vented degradation of crab processing waste can be achieved with
the addition of 1.5% propionic/formic acid. On day 28, the TMA concentration increased
from 30.76 to 30.77. It went from 40.51% to 47.02% on the dry basis. It is a reflection of
the loss of other components. The waste was ensiled with wheat straw, sugarcane molasses
and water. There was an increase in lactic acid in the silages made with or without
inoculant. With crab waste stored for 2 d, the highest pH and lowest lactic acid
concentration was observed. Residual acids may have restricted the growth of yeast. Crab
processing waste can be preserved with either.2% of NaOC1 or.4% hydro- 45.

It was possible to prevent deterioration up to d 7. When NaOC1 was used, the ratio of TMA
to N/100 g increased from 3.70 to 12.85. When H2O2 was used, the reduction in pH and high
level of lactic acid indicated that the chemicals prevented degradation, and enhanced
fermentation of the crab waste-straw mixture. The crab waste was retarded by.4% NaOC1 and
1.5% acetic acid. The highest and lowest concentration of TMA were found in the NaOH
treated waste. The highest and lowest true protein content was found in the acetic acid
treated waste. The production of NH3 was affected by the use of 1.5% NaOH. The highest
concentration of H2S was found in the waste that was treated with NaOH. The waste was
preserved for a minimum of 10 d with the use of 1% NaNO2 and 4% sodium/calcium
hypochlorite. When 1% NaNO2 was used, H2S was not detected throughout the 15 d of
preservation. The highest and lowest concentrations of the TMA were found in the waste
that was treated with 1% NaNO2. Ammonia and H2S concentrations were highest for the waste

In 1988 wood products firms responsible for over one third of the structural panel
production and two thirds of the softwood lumber in Canada and the United States were
surveyed to produce an inventory of new processing technologies adopted for each of these

structural panels. The proportion of 1987 production that used each technology was
measured by the Use Intensity index. For different technologies, use intensity ranged from
less than 1% to more than 90%. Multivariate statistical analysis was used to find out
which technologies were compatible with each other. Different directions for forest and

For a firm to remain competitive, it must allocate its limited financial resources into
areas that will maintain or improve its performance. The adoption of innovative process
technologies in the manufacture of lumber and plywood is one area that always competes for
resources. Adoption's impact on a firm's performance has never been studied. This paper
looks at the importance of adopting innovative processing technologies on a firm's
performance by grouping firms producing softwood lumber and plywood using a hierarchical
clustering technique and then profiling these firms using descriptive statistics. This
technique, using firm controllable strategic variables as clustering criteria, is rarely
used in the forest products industry. Thirty-eight firms, responsible for over 30% of 1987
North American softwood lumber production and over 70% of softwood plywood production,
provided empirical evidence that increased adoption of innovative processing technologies
was linked to superior performance. Companies with high levels of adoption were gaining
market share. Firms with low levels of adoption were losing market share. There was no
correlation between firm size and degree of forward vertical integration. Strong support
for building products firms to allocate resources for the development and adoption of new
and innovative processing technologies is one of the strategic implications of this

The parent alkali beam and the crossed thermal beams of the K, Rb, Cs and CC14 have been
measured with respect to the parent alkali beam. The differential cross section is a
function of recoil velocity and cm angle in the center-of-mass coordinate system. The
transformation is carried out directly by selecting a single representative velocity in
each of the parent beams. The other method does not use the c.m. The coefficients
determined by a least-squares fit to the experimental data are represented by a many-term
polynomial in powers of ucose and usine. The cross sections of the two methods agree and
confirm the qualitative interpretation of previous experiments. The results obtained for
stripping the reactions of alkali atoms with halogens show a strong correlation between
the two peaks. As E' increases and K Rb Cs increases, the pattern shifts toward the

The survival value of different parts of the Redwinged Blackbird was determined by
comparing the factors that affect it in marsh and upland breeding habitats. The hypothesis
that Redwings are being excluded from their optimal niche space is supported by the
results. colony size, breeding density, and synchrony were greater in marsh than upland
habitat. The proportion of active nests that were successful, number of young fledged per
active nest, and number fledged per egg were all measures of nest success. The lower
reproductive success of upland populations was caused by a larger proportion of nest
destruction. The marsh's predation pressure was negatively correlated with the depth of
water beneath the nest, providing an anti-predator barrier that upland populations are
unable to achieve. The swamping effect on local predator populations is a result of the
synchrony and greater density of nesting in the marsh. Growth rates, weight at fledging,
and the number fledged per successful nest were similar in the two habi- tats indicating

																																					Abstract
Redwings in marshes tend to be more active than colonies in upland habitats, but the
duration of their activity is longer in large colonies. The variation in timing is
probably related to the vegetation in the habitat and not the size of the colony. The
Redwings' survival value was reduced due to the presence of a large number of prey in the
colonies studied. In large colonies, the percentage of nests predated was lower. During
the peak of the activity, the percentage of predated nests was lower in most colonies. The
Holling model can be applied to different sized colonies. Colony size is probably limited
by a territorial system that protects adequate resources. Smaller colonies might suffer

																																					Abstract
Increasing sophistication and precision of experimental tests of relativistic gravitation
theories has led to the need for a detailed. The Parametrized Post-Newtonian formalism
treats the post-Newtonian limit of arbitrary metric theories of gravity in terms of nine
metric parameters, whose values vary from theory to theory. The de- tailed definitions and
equations for the formalism are given, as well as the theoretical and experimental founda-
tions of the PPN formalism. According to some metric theories of gravity, a massive, self-
gravitating body's passive gravitational mass should not be equal to its inertial mass,
but should be an anisotropic tensor which depends on the body's self-gravitational energy.
The PPN formalism's theoretical structure is probed by two theorems. They state that a
metric theory of gravity has post-Newtonian integral conser- vation laws if and only if
its nine PPN parameters have values which satisfy a set of seven constraint equations.

																																					Abstract
TheASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL was published in 1971 The University of Chicago. All rights
belong to the person. It was printed in the U.S.A. The first in a series of theoretical
papers will discuss the experimental foundations of general relativity. The paper reviews,
modifies, and compares two very different theoretical frameworks. The Dicke framework
doesn\'t take into account the nature of gravity or the gross features of the interaction.
The postulates of the Parametrized Post- Neacionian framework are the two tentative
conclusions. Most of the theories of gravity that are compatible with experiment are
covered by the PPN framework. Future papers in this series will develop the PPN framework
in detail, and use it to analyze a variety of relativistic effects that should be visible
in the solar system during the coming decade. Since 1963, a number of discoveries and
observations have forced Astro- physicists to make general relativity a working tool in
their theoretical model building. It would be naive to think that the very astronomical
phenomena in which rela- tivistic gravity is crucial will provide the answer. The local
behavior of matter and magnetic fields are interwoven with the effects of gravity waves.
There is no hope of getting clean tests of the nature of gravity if they are separated.
The astrophysical enterprise uses the laws of gravity as an input and tries to get out in
for- mation about what the matter and fields are doing. The greatest hopes for clean tests
of gravity lie in space and laboratory technology. The National Science Foundation and the
Office of Naval Research supported the project. Theoretical Frameworks for Testing
Relativistic Gravity is the first paper in the series. The papers in this series will tend
to be theoretical and mathematical, with the exception of the present one. ""Relativistic
Gravity in the Solar System"" will be a companion series. It will look at the nature of
various effects and their prospects for detection in the next few decades. My students and
I dedicate this series of papers to Professor S. Chandrasekhar. Professor Chandrasekhar\'s
beautiful and systematic development of post-Newtonian hydrodynamics is an indispensable
foundation for the ""PPN framework"" developed and used in this series of papers.

equivalence principle is violated in Brans-Dicke theory when the two mass differ by a
small isotropic correction. The two results are explained. The work generalizes and agrees
with previous calculations. In Paper I of this series (Thorne and Will 1971), the
theoretical and experimental foundations for metric theories of gravity were described,
and qualitative aspects of the Parametrized Post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism were discussed.
There are postulates that there exists a metric of signature -2 which governs proper
length and proper time measurements, and that the response of stressed matter to gravity
be described by the equation V.T. The covariant derivative with respect to the metric is
V, and the total stress- energy tensor is T. In this paper, a series of metric parameters
will be used to develop the PPN formalism for perfect fluids. The ""Nordtvedt effect"" is a
rela- tivistic gravity problem. The principle of equivalence is violated by theNordtvedt
effect. According to a wide class of metric theories of gravity, different massive bodies
should fall with different accelerations. This means that the body\'s mass is no longer
equal to its weight. If m is the center mass of the body, a is the acceleration of its
center mass, and U is the external (Newtonian) potential, it can be measured by means of a
test. Permission was granted for this reproduced by the copyright owner. Permission is

																																					Abstract
There is a significant range of frequencies for a representative selection of spherical
earth models. Higher Love modes can be excited to the fundamental mode for both shallow
and deep sources under a variety of circum- stances, and thus higher mode interference is
an important factor to be taken into account in the proper interpretation and analysis of
Love waves. Simple theoretical computations reveal the nature of the effect of mode
contamination on measured phase velocities, and biases in the selection and analysis of
surface wave data make it appear likely that fundamental mode Love waves experiencing
higher mode inter-ference will exhibit high apparent phase velocities. It may not be
necessary to use complex or anisotropic models to explain the observations. The effects of

The seismology study of an ocean ridge earthquake swarm in the Gulf of California in 1969
has provided new information. Similar to a foreshock-mainshock-after shock sequence, but

greater than magnitude 5 continued for over two weeks. All sources are within 10 km of
each other and hypocenters are confined to the upper crust, according to near-source
travel time data. Teleseismic P-delays for rays travelling beneath this ridge may be
interpreted in terms of an upper mantle with compressional velocities five to ten per cent
less than normal mantle to a depth of 200 km. Average apparent stresses for all swarm
events are very similar, show no consistent pattern as a function of time, and are close
to values obtained from other ridges. A large component of normal faulting is shown in the

																																					Abstract
The basic observation of this study is that seismograms written in southern California
from earthquakes within the northern Gulf of California are different from those of most.
There is a visual difference between the Baja sources and the Gulf seismograms. This is
thought to be a source effect, reflecting the relatively small source dimen- sions and low
seismic moments of the Baja earthquakes. In principle, the differences in the seismograms
could be caused by a near-source or propagation path effect, but the similarity in paths
and the large magnitude of the observed difference argue against this explanation. There
are some North Baja sources with large moments and source dimensions that show that
different seismograms are produced by different sources. Preliminary examination of
seismo- grams from events within southern California suggests the same kinds of regional
variations there. The Northern Baja earthquakes have source dimensions at least a factor
of four smaller and seismic moments, an order of magnitude less than events of similar
local magnitude within Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Permission is

It is important that this operation converts a pair of block components into a system that

system to study. The degree of microphase separation was influenced by the degree of

There is an effect of copper on the growth of Pinus densiflora. Host growth at both 0 and
15 g/g copper was improved by Suillus pictus. There was no correlation between growth
under metal stress in pure culture and whether the fungus is an early or late stage
colonizer of the host. Mycorrhizal colonization was decreased by copper, but not by
Pisolithus tinctorius and P. bicolor. There was more branching in the presence of metal if
a fungus caused the host to produce branched mycorrhizal short roots. A decrease in copper
lost from mycorrhizal roots when compared to nonmycorrhizal roots was found in all of the
fungi tested. Mycorrhizal colonization increased root and shoot levels, and the increase
was most noticeable at higher copper levels. The percent of vascular tissue in the trees
was decreased by copper. colonization with P. tinctorius caused copper to be in the shoot.
It was likely that both symbionts were responsible for the formation of the mycorrhizal
association. When two fungi were present on the same host, copper altered the ratio of
short root branching patterns. There are different ways in which heavy metal stress
affects ectomycorrhizal fungi. Colonization of tree roots by aycorrhizal partner can
improve the growth of the tree in metal contaminated soil. When grown in high metal media,

be mycorrhizal. Pinus densiflora, a non host tree, was in- oculated with cultures of B.
merulioides. Shoot weights were not increased by inoculation. Short roots lacked root
hairs and had an internal structure similar to that of anycorrhizal rootlets. The short
roots were surrounded by a loose weft of hyphae. The root weight and branching were
increased in inoculated seedlings. The culture filtrates from the liquid cultures of B.

When compared with nonmycorrhizal plants, even at high soil copper levels, there was no
increase in iron and copper. Plants grown in low P soil were so small that comparisons of
mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal plants were not possible. The correlation between
photosynthetic rate and VA mycorrhizal colonization was not found. The results show that
the presence of VA mycorrhizal fungi has no effect on plant growth when exposed to copper.
Colonization of plants by vesicular-arbuscular (VA) or endomycorrhizal fungi stimulates

																																					Abstract
A survey of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on mine spoils was conducted in
southwest Virginia and central North Carolina. Prior to sampling, mining ceased at all
sites. The soil was tested for heavy metal and pH. More than 70% of the root systems
examined were colonized by VA fungi. In 39% of the samples, there were parasites. VA
mycorrhizal fungus was collected by the majority of people. When metals were present in
the soil, the roots were colonized by VA fungi. It is possible that there is an absence of
VA mycorrhizal fungi that is limiting plant growth on abandoned mines in southwest
Virginia and central North Carolina. Colonization of herbaceous plants by vesicular-
arbuscular (VA) mycorrhizal or endomycorrhizal fungi increases the amount of phosphorus in
the soil. Many angiosperms are likely obligately VA mycorrhizal in the soil. VA
mycorrhizae can increase the amount of metalliferous micronutri- ents. The colonization of
host roots by VA mycorrhizal fungi has been shown to decrease or even be eliminated by
high levels of heavy metals in the soil. There are differences between the two types of VA
mycorrhizal spores, and zinc, copper, and manganese may be used to prevent the growth of
them. There is a survey of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on mine spoils.

The value of certain chemicals to retard the decline of crab processing waste was studied
in four experiments. Pre- vented degradation of crab processing waste can be achieved with
the addition of 1.5% propionic/formic acid. On day 28, the TMA concentration increased
from 30.76 to 30.77. It went from 40.51% to 47.02% on the dry basis. It is a reflection of

and water. There was an increase in lactic acid in the silages made with or without
inoculant. With crab waste stored for 2 d, the highest pH and lowest lactic acid

production and two thirds of the softwood lumber in Canada and the United States were
surveyed to produce an inventory of new processing technologies adopted for each of these

measured by the Use Intensity index. For different technologies, use intensity ranged from
less than 1% to more than 90%. Multivariate statistical analysis was used to find out
which technologies were compatible with each other. Different directions for forest and

For a firm to remain competitive, it must allocate its limited financial resources into
areas that will maintain or improve its performance. The adoption of innovative process
technologies in the manufacture of lumber and plywood is one area that always competes for
resources. Adoption's impact on a firm's performance has never been studied. This paper
looks at the importance of adopting innovative processing technologies on a firm's
performance by grouping firms producing softwood lumber and plywood using a hierarchical
clustering technique and then profiling these firms using descriptive statistics. This
technique, using firm controllable strategic variables as clustering criteria, is rarely
used in the forest products industry. Thirty-eight firms, responsible for over 30% of 1987
North American softwood lumber production and over 70% of softwood plywood production,
provided empirical evidence that increased adoption of innovative processing technologies
was linked to superior performance. Companies with high levels of adoption were gaining
market share. Firms with low levels of adoption were losing market share. There was no
correlation between firm size and degree of forward vertical integration. Strong support
for building products firms to allocate resources for the development and adoption of new
and innovative processing technologies is one of the strategic implications of this
research. 81

The parent alkali beam and the crossed thermal beams of the K, Rb, Cs and CC14 have been
measured with respect to the parent alkali beam. The differential cross section is a
function of recoil velocity and cm angle in the center-of-mass coordinate system. The
transformation is carried out directly by selecting a single representative velocity in

determined by a least-squares fit to the experimental data are represented by a many-term

confirm the qualitative interpretation of previous experiments. The results obtained for
stripping the reactions of alkali atoms with halogens show a strong correlation between

normally accommodated by suspension feeders are present in most shallow water
environments. The Lucinacea can accept and process large detrital particles. Most other

The survival value of different parts of the Redwinged Blackbird was determined by
comparing the factors that affect it in marsh and upland breeding habitats. The hypothesis
that Redwings are being excluded from their optimal niche space is supported by the
results. colony size, breeding density, and synchrony were greater in marsh than upland
habitat. The proportion of active nests that were successful, number of young fledged per
active nest, and number fledged per egg were all measures of nest success. The lower
reproductive success of upland populations was caused by a larger proportion of nest
destruction. The marsh's predation pressure was negatively correlated with the depth of
water beneath the nest, providing an anti-predator barrier that upland populations are
unable to achieve. The swamping effect on local predator populations is a result of the
synchrony and greater density of nesting in the marsh. Growth rates, weight at fledging,
and the number fledged per successful nest were similar in the two habi- tats indicating

																																					Abstract
Redwings in marshes tend to be more active than colonies in upland habitats, but the
duration of their activity is longer in large colonies. The variation in timing is
probably related to the vegetation in the habitat and not the size of the colony. The
Redwings' survival value was reduced due to the presence of a large number of prey in the
colonies studied. In large colonies, the percentage of nests predated was lower. During
the peak of the activity, the percentage of predated nests was lower in most colonies. The
Holling model can be applied to different sized colonies. Colony size is probably limited
by a territorial system that protects adequate resources. Smaller colonies might suffer
less predation, but genetic exchange can be produced with the permission of the copyright

The mean weight at fledging is the same for Redwing nestlings in marsh and upland
habitats. Upland nestlings are larger until 8 days of age. In both habitats, the
percentage of nestlings that die from starvation is the same. The mean number is similar
between habitats. It is suggested that the relative abundance of food is the same for
nestlings in either marshes or uplands, but that a higher absolute abundance of food in
marshes makes large, dense colonies possible. There are obvious differences in the

Increasing sophistication and precision of experimental tests of relativistic gravitation
theories has led to the need for a detailed. The Parametrized Post-Newtonian formalism
treats the post-Newtonian limit of arbitrary metric theories of gravity in terms of nine
metric parameters, whose values vary from theory to theory. The de- tailed definitions and
equations for the formalism are given, as well as the theoretical and experimental founda-
tions of the PPN formalism. According to some metric theories of gravity, a massive, self-
gravitating body's passive gravitational mass should not be equal to its inertial mass,
but should be an anisotropic tensor which depends on the body's self-gravitational energy.
The PPN formalism's theoretical structure is probed by two theorems. They state that a
metric theory of gravity has post-Newtonian integral conser- vation laws if and only if
its nine PPN parameters have values which satisfy a set of seven constraint equations.

TheASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL was published in 1971 The University of Chicago. All rights
belong to the person. It was printed in the U.S.A. The first in a series of theoretical
papers will discuss the experimental foundations of general relativity. The paper reviews,
modifies, and compares two very different theoretical frameworks. The Dicke framework
doesn\'t take into account the nature of gravity or the gross features of the interaction.
The postulates of the Parametrized Post- Neacionian framework are the two tentative
conclusions. Most of the theories of gravity that are compatible with experiment are
covered by the PPN framework. Future papers in this series will develop the PPN framework
in detail, and use it to analyze a variety of relativistic effects that should be visible
in the solar system during the coming decade. Since 1963, a number of discoveries and
observations have forced Astro- physicists to make general relativity a working tool in
their theoretical model building. It would be naive to think that the very astronomical
phenomena in which rela- tivistic gravity is crucial will provide the answer. The local
behavior of matter and magnetic fields are interwoven with the effects of gravity waves.
There is no hope of getting clean tests of the nature of gravity if they are separated.
The astrophysical enterprise uses the laws of gravity as an input and tries to get out in
for- mation about what the matter and fields are doing. The greatest hopes for clean tests
of gravity lie in space and laboratory technology. The National Science Foundation and the
Office of Naval Research supported the project. Theoretical Frameworks for Testing
Relativistic Gravity is the first paper in the series. The papers in this series will tend
to be theoretical and mathematical, with the exception of the present one. ""Relativistic
Gravity in the Solar System"" will be a companion series. It will look at the nature of
various effects and their prospects for detection in the next few decades. My students and
I dedicate this series of papers to Professor S. Chandrasekhar. Professor Chandrasekhar\'s
beautiful and systematic development of post-Newtonian hydrodynamics is an indispensable
foundation for the ""PPN framework"" developed and used in this series of papers.

equivalence principle is violated in Brans-Dicke theory when the two mass differ by a
small isotropic correction. The two results are explained. The work generalizes and agrees
with previous calculations. In Paper I of this series (Thorne and Will 1971), the
theoretical and experimental foundations for metric theories of gravity were described,
and qualitative aspects of the Parametrized Post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism were discussed.
There are postulates that there exists a metric of signature -2 which governs proper
length and proper time measurements, and that the response of stressed matter to gravity
be described by the equation V.T. The covariant derivative with respect to the metric is
V, and the total stress- energy tensor is T. In this paper, a series of metric parameters
will be used to develop the PPN formalism for perfect fluids. The ""Nordtvedt effect"" is a
rela- tivistic gravity problem. The principle of equivalence is violated by theNordtvedt
effect. According to a wide class of metric theories of gravity, different massive bodies
should fall with different accelerations. This means that the body\'s mass is no longer
equal to its weight. If m is the center mass of the body, a is the acceleration of its
center mass, and U is the external (Newtonian) potential, it can be measured by means of a
test. Permission was granted for this reproduced by the copyright owner. Permission is

There is a significant range of frequencies for a representative selection of spherical
earth models. Higher Love modes can be excited to the fundamental mode for both shallow
and deep sources under a variety of circum- stances, and thus higher mode interference is
an important factor to be taken into account in the proper interpretation and analysis of
Love waves. Simple theoretical computations reveal the nature of the effect of mode
contamination on measured phase velocities, and biases in the selection and analysis of
surface wave data make it appear likely that fundamental mode Love waves experiencing
higher mode inter-ference will exhibit high apparent phase velocities. It may not be

																																					Abstract
The basic observation of this study is that seismograms written in southern California
from earthquakes within the northern Gulf of California are different from those of most.
There is a visual difference between the Baja sources and the Gulf seismograms. This is
thought to be a source effect, reflecting the relatively small source dimen- sions and low
seismic moments of the Baja earthquakes. In principle, the differences in the seismograms
could be caused by a near-source or propagation path effect, but the similarity in paths
and the large magnitude of the observed difference argue against this explanation. There
are some North Baja sources with large moments and source dimensions that show that
different seismograms are produced by different sources. Preliminary examination of
seismo- grams from events within southern California suggests the same kinds of regional
variations there. The Northern Baja earthquakes have source dimensions at least a factor
of four smaller and seismic moments, an order of magnitude less than events of similar

produced by S. pictus was 60 g/g copper. The yellow and black hyphae of Piloderma bicolor
and Cenococcum graniforme were unaffected by copper. The activity of P. tinctorius and S.

activated and repressed by the addition of the polyamines putrescine and spermidine. The
Polyamine content of P. tinctorius and B. merulioides was not altered by the addition of

is located in Virginia. The most tolerant of copper were Pisolithus tinctorius and
Boletinellus merulioides. Piloderma bicolor was very tolerant. The copper ion was
deposited outside the cell wall in S. pictus and inside the cell wall in P. tintorius. The
results suggest that there may be differences in growth rates observed on copper amended
media. It is likely incorrect to postulate a single mechanism for metal tolerance and
subsequent improvement of host plant growth in such a diverse group of organisms. Key
words are copper, ultrastructure, tolerance, polysaccharides, cell walls and
ectomycorrhizae. The growth of other organisms is severely restricted by the ability of
some fungi to grow at high levels of copper. A number of mechanisms of copper tolerance
can be found in the fungi. The production and deposition of copper oxalate in the
extracellular hyphal sheath of some wood-rotting fungi is one example. There is a
deposition of hydrogen sulfide in the cell wall of S. cereviseae.

																																					Abstract
There is an effect of copper on the growth of Pinus densiflora. Host growth at both 0 and
15 g/g copper was improved by Suillus pictus. There was no correlation between growth
under metal stress in pure culture and whether the fungus is an early or late stage
colonizer of the host. Mycorrhizal colonization was decreased by copper, but not by
Pisolithus tinctorius and P. bicolor. There was more branching in the presence of metal if
a fungus caused the host to produce branched mycorrhizal short roots. A decrease in copper
lost from mycorrhizal roots when compared to nonmycorrhizal roots was found in all of the
fungi tested. Mycorrhizal colonization increased root and shoot levels, and the increase
was most noticeable at higher copper levels. The percent of vascular tissue in the trees
was decreased by copper. colonization with P. tinctorius caused copper to be in the shoot.
It was likely that both symbionts were responsible for the formation of the mycorrhizal
association. When two fungi were present on the same host, copper altered the ratio of
short root branching patterns. There are different ways in which heavy metal stress
affects ectomycorrhizal fungi. Colonization of tree roots by aycorrhizal partner can
improve the growth of the tree in metal contaminated soil. When grown in high metal media,
Mycorrhizal Betula can incorporate less zinc and nickel into the aboveground parts of the
plant. Mycorrhizal Pinus virginiana needles have less zinc and manganese than
nonmycorrhizal controls. There is an Effect of copper on the growth of Pinus densiflora

																																					Abstract
The Department of Biology is at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University
Blacksburg. Although it is associated with Fraxinus americana, it has never been proven to
be mycorrhizal. Pinus densiflora, a non host tree, was in- oculated with cultures of B.
merulioides. Shoot weights were not increased by inoculation. Short roots lacked root
hairs and had an internal structure similar to that of anycorrhizal rootlets. The short
roots were surrounded by a loose weft of hyphae. The root weight and branching were
increased in inoculated seedlings. The culture filtrates from the liquid cultures of B.
merulioides and Pisolithus tinctorius were analyzed. Both fungi produced measureable
quantities of indole-3-acetic acid. The results show that IAA is the compound responsible
for the dichotomization in the short roots of P. densiflora. Key words: Boletinellus
merulioides, Pisolithus tinctorius, IAA, HPLC, and ectomycorrhizae are commonly associated
in nature with members of the Fagus. Boletinellus merulioides is found in the southeastern
United States. Murrill is collected near Fagus americana L. B. meruliodes is a member of
the Boletaceae, a family that some authors consider to be exclusively mycorrhizal. The
ability to form a mycorrhizal association has not yet been demonstrated in pure culture
synthesis. The root of Pinus densiflora does not have mycorrhizal formation.

When compared with nonmycorrhizal plants, even at high soil copper levels, there was no
increase in iron and copper. Plants grown in low P soil were so small that comparisons of
mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal plants were not possible. The correlation between
photosynthetic rate and VA mycorrhizal colonization was not found. The results show that
the presence of VA mycorrhizal fungi has no effect on plant growth when exposed to copper.
Colonization of plants by vesicular-arbuscular (VA) or endomycorrhizal fungi stimulates

																																					Abstract
A survey of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on mine spoils was conducted in
southwest Virginia and central North Carolina. Prior to sampling, mining ceased at all
sites. The soil was tested for heavy metal and pH. More than 70% of the root systems
examined were colonized by VA fungi. In 39% of the samples, there were parasites. VA
mycorrhizal fungus was collected by the majority of people. When metals were present in
the soil, the roots were colonized by VA fungi. It is possible that there is an absence of
VA mycorrhizal fungi that is limiting plant growth on abandoned mines in southwest
Virginia and central North Carolina. Colonization of herbaceous plants by vesicular-
arbuscular (VA) mycorrhizal or endomycorrhizal fungi increases the amount of phosphorus in
the soil. Many angiosperms are likely obligately VA mycorrhizal in the soil. VA
mycorrhizae can increase the amount of metalliferous micronutri- ents. The colonization of
host roots by VA mycorrhizal fungi has been shown to decrease or even be eliminated by
high levels of heavy metals in the soil. There are differences between the two types of VA
mycorrhizal spores, and zinc, copper, and manganese may be used to prevent the growth of
them. There is a survey of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on mine spoils.

The value of certain chemicals to retard the decline of crab processing waste was studied

and water. There was an increase in lactic acid in the silages made with or without
inoculant. With crab waste stored for 2 d, the highest pH and lowest lactic acid
concentration was observed. Residual acids may have restricted the growth of yeast. Crab

For a firm to remain competitive, it must allocate its limited financial resources into
areas that will maintain or improve its performance. The adoption of innovative process
technologies in the manufacture of lumber and plywood is one area that always competes for
resources. Adoption's impact on a firm's performance has never been studied. This paper
looks at the importance of adopting innovative processing technologies on a firm's
performance by grouping firms producing softwood lumber and plywood using a hierarchical
clustering technique and then profiling these firms using descriptive statistics. This
technique, using firm controllable strategic variables as clustering criteria, is rarely
used in the forest products industry. Thirty-eight firms, responsible for over 30% of 1987
North American softwood lumber production and over 70% of softwood plywood production,
provided empirical evidence that increased adoption of innovative processing technologies
was linked to superior performance. Companies with high levels of adoption were gaining
market share. Firms with low levels of adoption were losing market share. There was no
correlation between firm size and degree of forward vertical integration. Strong support
for building products firms to allocate resources for the development and adoption of new
and innovative processing technologies is one of the strategic implications of this
research. 81

The parent alkali beam and the crossed thermal beams of the K, Rb, Cs and CC14 have been

An international corporation has several product-market strategies. Minor modifications of
existing products can be moved into new foreign markets. Difficulties of such a move are
to determine which variant should be used in a market and associated optimum transfer or
sales prices. Fixed costs of producing new product variations, shipping, inventory, and
tariffs are included in the costs. Legal, cultural and environmental considerations need
to be looked at. The model presented in the paper can be used to develop an optimum
marketing strategy. A solution procedure can be used to solve large problems and can be

The modular design problem was set up by David Evans. There are several components that
make up the module in this problem. All component re- quirements will need to be satisfied
with j, yj modules. It's difficult to design a module that the requirements are satisfied
at a minimum cost of surplus components. The problem is Minimize x,y i for all i,j Subject
Xisy are positive integers and 'i' dj are constants. There are two parts to the paper. The
difficulties of rounding the continuous solution are described in the first part of the
problem. There are some properties of the constraint set that aid in the solution of the
problem. The two procedures outlined by Evans and Charnes and Kirby for the non-integer
case can't be used to find the integer solution. An integer branch and bound technique has
been shown to be useful in the solution of small problems and has the potential to be used
in larger problems. The objective func tion is discussed in the second part of the paper.

The survival value of different parts of the Redwinged Blackbird was determined by
comparing the factors that affect it in marsh and upland breeding habitats. The hypothesis
that Redwings are being excluded from their optimal niche space is supported by the
results. colony size, breeding density, and synchrony were greater in marsh than upland
habitat. The proportion of active nests that were successful, number of young fledged per
active nest, and number fledged per egg were all measures of nest success. The lower
reproductive success of upland populations was caused by a larger proportion of nest
destruction. The marsh's predation pressure was negatively correlated with the depth of
water beneath the nest, providing an anti-predator barrier that upland populations are
unable to achieve. The swamping effect on local predator populations is a result of the
synchrony and greater density of nesting in the marsh. Growth rates, weight at fledging,
and the number fledged per successful nest were similar in the two habi- tats indicating

																																					Abstract
Redwings in marshes tend to be more active than colonies in upland habitats, but the
duration of their activity is longer in large colonies. The variation in timing is
probably related to the vegetation in the habitat and not the size of the colony. The
Redwings' survival value was reduced due to the presence of a large number of prey in the
colonies studied. In large colonies, the percentage of nests predated was lower. During
the peak of the activity, the percentage of predated nests was lower in most colonies. The
Holling model can be applied to different sized colonies. Colony size is probably limited
by a territorial system that protects adequate resources. Smaller colonies might suffer

Increasing sophistication and precision of experimental tests of relativistic gravitation
theories has led to the need for a detailed. The Parametrized Post-Newtonian formalism
treats the post-Newtonian limit of arbitrary metric theories of gravity in terms of nine
metric parameters, whose values vary from theory to theory. The de- tailed definitions and
equations for the formalism are given, as well as the theoretical and experimental founda-
tions of the PPN formalism. According to some metric theories of gravity, a massive, self-
gravitating body's passive gravitational mass should not be equal to its inertial mass,
but should be an anisotropic tensor which depends on the body's self-gravitational energy.
The PPN formalism's theoretical structure is probed by two theorems. They state that a
metric theory of gravity has post-Newtonian integral conser- vation laws if and only if
its nine PPN parameters have values which satisfy a set of seven constraint equations.

TheASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL was published in 1971 The University of Chicago. All rights
belong to the person. It was printed in the U.S.A. The first in a series of theoretical
papers will discuss the experimental foundations of general relativity. The paper reviews,
modifies, and compares two very different theoretical frameworks. The Dicke framework
doesn\'t take into account the nature of gravity or the gross features of the interaction.
The postulates of the Parametrized Post- Neacionian framework are the two tentative
conclusions. Most of the theories of gravity that are compatible with experiment are
covered by the PPN framework. Future papers in this series will develop the PPN framework
in detail, and use it to analyze a variety of relativistic effects that should be visible
in the solar system during the coming decade. Since 1963, a number of discoveries and
observations have forced Astro- physicists to make general relativity a working tool in
their theoretical model building. It would be naive to think that the very astronomical
phenomena in which rela- tivistic gravity is crucial will provide the answer. The local
behavior of matter and magnetic fields are interwoven with the effects of gravity waves.
There is no hope of getting clean tests of the nature of gravity if they are separated.
The astrophysical enterprise uses the laws of gravity as an input and tries to get out in
for- mation about what the matter and fields are doing. The greatest hopes for clean tests
of gravity lie in space and laboratory technology. The National Science Foundation and the
Office of Naval Research supported the project. Theoretical Frameworks for Testing
Relativistic Gravity is the first paper in the series. The papers in this series will tend
to be theoretical and mathematical, with the exception of the present one. ""Relativistic
Gravity in the Solar System"" will be a companion series. It will look at the nature of
various effects and their prospects for detection in the next few decades. My students and
I dedicate this series of papers to Professor S. Chandrasekhar. Professor Chandrasekhar\'s
beautiful and systematic development of post-Newtonian hydrodynamics is an indispensable
foundation for the ""PPN framework"" developed and used in this series of papers.

equivalence principle is violated in Brans-Dicke theory when the two mass differ by a
small isotropic correction. The two results are explained. The work generalizes and agrees
with previous calculations. In Paper I of this series (Thorne and Will 1971), the
theoretical and experimental foundations for metric theories of gravity were described,
and qualitative aspects of the Parametrized Post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism were discussed.
There are postulates that there exists a metric of signature -2 which governs proper
length and proper time measurements, and that the response of stressed matter to gravity
be described by the equation V.T. The covariant derivative with respect to the metric is
V, and the total stress- energy tensor is T. In this paper, a series of metric parameters
will be used to develop the PPN formalism for perfect fluids. The ""Nordtvedt effect"" is a
rela- tivistic gravity problem. The principle of equivalence is violated by theNordtvedt
effect. According to a wide class of metric theories of gravity, different massive bodies
should fall with different accelerations. This means that the body\'s mass is no longer
equal to its weight. If m is the center mass of the body, a is the acceleration of its
center mass, and U is the external (Newtonian) potential, it can be measured by means of a
test. Permission was granted for this reproduced by the copyright owner. Permission is

There is a significant range of frequencies for a representative selection of spherical
earth models. Higher Love modes can be excited to the fundamental mode for both shallow
and deep sources under a variety of circum- stances, and thus higher mode interference is
an important factor to be taken into account in the proper interpretation and analysis of
Love waves. Simple theoretical computations reveal the nature of the effect of mode
contamination on measured phase velocities, and biases in the selection and analysis of
surface wave data make it appear likely that fundamental mode Love waves experiencing
higher mode inter-ference will exhibit high apparent phase velocities. It may not be

The basic observation of this study is that seismograms written in southern California
from earthquakes within the northern Gulf of California are different from those of most.
There is a visual difference between the Baja sources and the Gulf seismograms. This is
thought to be a source effect, reflecting the relatively small source dimen- sions and low
seismic moments of the Baja earthquakes. In principle, the differences in the seismograms
could be caused by a near-source or propagation path effect, but the similarity in paths
and the large magnitude of the observed difference argue against this explanation. There
are some North Baja sources with large moments and source dimensions that show that
different seismograms are produced by different sources. Preliminary examination of
seismo- grams from events within southern California suggests the same kinds of regional
variations there. The Northern Baja earthquakes have source dimensions at least a factor
of four smaller and seismic moments, an order of magnitude less than events of similar

A combination of basic polyhedral units can be used to model the physical properties of
silicate minerals. They could be modeled as the sum of polyhedral contributions. The
contribution of H2O-FeO(6)-Fe(OH) has been determined by multiple regression. We can use
the data to estimate the AG and AH, of other silicate minerals from a weighted sum of the
contribution of each oxide and hydroxide component. The method outlined here can be used
to estimate the thermodynamic properties of silicate phases which are too complex or
impure to give reliable calorimetric measurements. The minerals used in the model have
associated average residuals of 0.26% and 0.24%. The average difference between the
measured and predicted values of 0.25 for AG for 18 minerals and 0.22 for 20 minerals is
less than the difference between the measured and predicted values of 0.25 for AG for 20
minerals. 47 is a number.

The technique that we developed to estimate AGP of silicate minerals by summing the
contribution of polyhedral components can be extended to predict the free energy of
formation of silicate minerals at higher temperatures. Multiple linear regression was used
to find the contribution of the Al2O3(4) - Al2O3(6) The gi coefficients from this model
can be used to calculate the enthalpy of one mole of each oxide or hydroxide component at
a higher temperature. Two seperate linear regressions were used to determine gwater. For
21 minerals used in the model, there are differences of 0.20%, 0.20%, and 0.22% at 400,
500, and 600 K. Experimentally measured AGF versus predicted AGF for four, three, and two

The effect of copper on the activity of the tyrannosaurus rex is studied. Two of the
fungi, Pisolithus tinctorius and Boletinellus merulioides, have naturally brown pigmented
hyphae. The hyphae were developed in the presence of copper. The extracellular tyrosinase
produced by S. pictus was 60 g/g copper. The yellow and black hyphae of Piloderma bicolor
and Cenococcum graniforme were unaffected by copper. The activity of P. tinctorius and S.
granulatus decreased when they were grown under copper stress. The reaction mixture was
activated and repressed by the addition of the polyamines putrescine and spermidine. The
Polyamine content of P. tinctorius and B. merulioides was not altered by the addition of
copper. A decrease in the polyamine content may indicate a change in the permeability of
the cells. Key words are copper and polyamines. Copper can be toxic at relatively low
concentrations, but is essential for normal growth and development. The availability of
copper increases when the pH of the growth medium decreases. The mechanisms of tolerate

																																					Abstract
The Department of Biology Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Blacksburg
is located in Virginia. The most tolerant of copper were Pisolithus tinctorius and
Boletinellus merulioides. Piloderma bicolor was very tolerant. The copper ion was
deposited outside the cell wall in S. pictus and inside the cell wall in P. tintorius. The
results suggest that there may be differences in growth rates observed on copper amended
media. It is likely incorrect to postulate a single mechanism for metal tolerance and
subsequent improvement of host plant growth in such a diverse group of organisms. Key
words are copper, ultrastructure, tolerance, polysaccharides, cell walls and
ectomycorrhizae. The growth of other organisms is severely restricted by the ability of
some fungi to grow at high levels of copper. A number of mechanisms of copper tolerance
can be found in the fungi. The production and deposition of copper oxalate in the
extracellular hyphal sheath of some wood-rotting fungi is one example. There is a
deposition of hydrogen sulfide in the cell wall of S. cereviseae.

																																					Abstract
There is an effect of copper on the growth of Pinus densiflora. Host growth at both 0 and
15 g/g copper was improved by Suillus pictus. There was no correlation between growth
under metal stress in pure culture and whether the fungus is an early or late stage
colonizer of the host. Mycorrhizal colonization was decreased by copper, but not by
Pisolithus tinctorius and P. bicolor. There was more branching in the presence of metal if
a fungus caused the host to produce branched mycorrhizal short roots. A decrease in copper
lost from mycorrhizal roots when compared to nonmycorrhizal roots was found in all of the
fungi tested. Mycorrhizal colonization increased root and shoot levels, and the increase
was most noticeable at higher copper levels. The percent of vascular tissue in the trees
was decreased by copper. colonization with P. tinctorius caused copper to be in the shoot.
It was likely that both symbionts were responsible for the formation of the mycorrhizal
association. When two fungi were present on the same host, copper altered the ratio of
short root branching patterns. There are different ways in which heavy metal stress
affects ectomycorrhizal fungi. Colonization of tree roots by aycorrhizal partner can
improve the growth of the tree in metal contaminated soil. When grown in high metal media,
Mycorrhizal Betula can incorporate less zinc and nickel into the aboveground parts of the

																																					Abstract
The Department of Biology is at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University
Blacksburg. Although it is associated with Fraxinus americana, it has never been proven to
be mycorrhizal. Pinus densiflora, a non host tree, was in- oculated with cultures of B.
merulioides. Shoot weights were not increased by inoculation. Short roots lacked root
hairs and had an internal structure similar to that of anycorrhizal rootlets. The short
roots were surrounded by a loose weft of hyphae. The root weight and branching were
increased in inoculated seedlings. The culture filtrates from the liquid cultures of B.
merulioides and Pisolithus tinctorius were analyzed. Both fungi produced measureable
quantities of indole-3-acetic acid. The results show that IAA is the compound responsible
for the dichotomization in the short roots of P. densiflora. Key words: Boletinellus
merulioides, Pisolithus tinctorius, IAA, HPLC, and ectomycorrhizae are commonly associated

technique, using firm controllable strategic variables as clustering criteria, is rarely
used in the forest products industry. Thirty-eight firms, responsible for over 30% of 1987
North American softwood lumber production and over 70% of softwood plywood production,
provided empirical evidence that increased adoption of innovative processing technologies
was linked to superior performance. Companies with high levels of adoption were gaining
market share. Firms with low levels of adoption were losing market share. There was no

the product, the simple application of kinematic relations suffices to determine the c.m.

proceed in this case is to ignore the spread. A more rigorous method uses the least
squares fitting technique to give a c.m. cross section which reproduces the data after

The distributions of H and D atoms produced in cross-beam reactions have been measured.
The reaction exoergicity varies from AD 2 17 kcal/mole for H + KF to -4 kcal/mole for H +

mass system. The reaction cross sections vary from Q 2 to 25 a2. The magnitude doesn't
correlate with AD or the identity of the halogen. Qr is larger for the Cs reaction than it
is for K and D is larger than it is for H. The shape of the dis-tribution is similar for K
and Cs and for H and D reactions, but the peak is different for the KF and CsF reactions.

The survival value of different parts of the Redwinged Blackbird was determined by
comparing the factors that affect it in marsh and upland breeding habitats. The hypothesis
that Redwings are being excluded from their optimal niche space is supported by the
results. colony size, breeding density, and synchrony were greater in marsh than upland
habitat. The proportion of active nests that were successful, number of young fledged per
active nest, and number fledged per egg were all measures of nest success. The lower
reproductive success of upland populations was caused by a larger proportion of nest
destruction. The marsh's predation pressure was negatively correlated with the depth of
water beneath the nest, providing an anti-predator barrier that upland populations are
unable to achieve. The swamping effect on local predator populations is a result of the
synchrony and greater density of nesting in the marsh. Growth rates, weight at fledging,

Redwings in marshes tend to be more active than colonies in upland habitats, but the
duration of their activity is longer in large colonies. The variation in timing is
probably related to the vegetation in the habitat and not the size of the colony. The
Redwings' survival value was reduced due to the presence of a large number of prey in the
colonies studied. In large colonies, the percentage of nests predated was lower. During
the peak of the activity, the percentage of predated nests was lower in most colonies. The
Holling model can be applied to different sized colonies. Colony size is probably limited

Increasing sophistication and precision of experimental tests of relativistic gravitation
theories has led to the need for a detailed. The Parametrized Post-Newtonian formalism
treats the post-Newtonian limit of arbitrary metric theories of gravity in terms of nine
metric parameters, whose values vary from theory to theory. The de- tailed definitions and
equations for the formalism are given, as well as the theoretical and experimental founda-
tions of the PPN formalism. According to some metric theories of gravity, a massive, self-
gravitating body's passive gravitational mass should not be equal to its inertial mass,
but should be an anisotropic tensor which depends on the body's self-gravitational energy.
The PPN formalism's theoretical structure is probed by two theorems. They state that a
metric theory of gravity has post-Newtonian integral conser- vation laws if and only if
its nine PPN parameters have values which satisfy a set of seven constraint equations.

papers will discuss the experimental foundations of general relativity. The paper reviews,
modifies, and compares two very different theoretical frameworks. The Dicke framework
doesn\'t take into account the nature of gravity or the gross features of the interaction.
The postulates of the Parametrized Post- Neacionian framework are the two tentative
conclusions. Most of the theories of gravity that are compatible with experiment are
covered by the PPN framework. Future papers in this series will develop the PPN framework
in detail, and use it to analyze a variety of relativistic effects that should be visible
in the solar system during the coming decade. Since 1963, a number of discoveries and
observations have forced Astro- physicists to make general relativity a working tool in
their theoretical model building. It would be naive to think that the very astronomical
phenomena in which rela- tivistic gravity is crucial will provide the answer. The local
behavior of matter and magnetic fields are interwoven with the effects of gravity waves.
There is no hope of getting clean tests of the nature of gravity if they are separated.
The astrophysical enterprise uses the laws of gravity as an input and tries to get out in
for- mation about what the matter and fields are doing. The greatest hopes for clean tests
of gravity lie in space and laboratory technology. The National Science Foundation and the

various effects and their prospects for detection in the next few decades. My students and

with previous calculations. In Paper I of this series (Thorne and Will 1971), the
theoretical and experimental foundations for metric theories of gravity were described,
and qualitative aspects of the Parametrized Post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism were discussed.
There are postulates that there exists a metric of signature -2 which governs proper
length and proper time measurements, and that the response of stressed matter to gravity
be described by the equation V.T. The covariant derivative with respect to the metric is
V, and the total stress- energy tensor is T. In this paper, a series of metric parameters
will be used to develop the PPN formalism for perfect fluids. The ""Nordtvedt effect"" is a
rela- tivistic gravity problem. The principle of equivalence is violated by theNordtvedt
effect. According to a wide class of metric theories of gravity, different massive bodies
should fall with different accelerations. This means that the body\'s mass is no longer
equal to its weight. If m is the center mass of the body, a is the acceleration of its
center mass, and U is the external (Newtonian) potential, it can be measured by means of a
test. Permission was granted for this reproduced by the copyright owner. Permission is

The basic observation of this study is that seismograms written in southern California
from earthquakes within the northern Gulf of California are different from those of most.
There is a visual difference between the Baja sources and the Gulf seismograms. This is
thought to be a source effect, reflecting the relatively small source dimen- sions and low
seismic moments of the Baja earthquakes. In principle, the differences in the seismograms
could be caused by a near-source or propagation path effect, but the similarity in paths
and the large magnitude of the observed difference argue against this explanation. There
are some North Baja sources with large moments and source dimensions that show that
different seismograms are produced by different sources. Preliminary examination of
seismo- grams from events within southern California suggests the same kinds of regional
variations there. The Northern Baja earthquakes have source dimensions at least a factor
of four smaller and seismic moments, an order of magnitude less than events of similar

It is important that this operation converts a pair of block components into a system that

																																					Abstract
In the southeastern USA, forage availability in the summer is an important limitation to
the size of herds. Tall-growing, perennial, warm-season grasses that produce 65 to 75% of
their yield in mid-summer may provide needed summer grazing; however, their establishment
is often slow and inconsistent when compared to cool-season species. To make these species
less vulnerable to weed competition, methods are needed. The two tall-growing, perennial,
warm-season grasses were planted in Blacksburg, VA located at 37 11' N 80 25' W at 610 m
elevation on a Grose close soil (clayey, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludult). The establishment

effect of atrazine was moderated by the addition of carbofuran. Direct statistical
comparison of species was not possible due to separate plantings. Atrazine was not harmful
to either species. The observations were confirmed by the yields in the year after
planting. At the time of planting, yields increased in all four experiments and with both

																																					Abstract
Cool-season perennial grass productivity plummets during hot, dry weather. In the United
States and especially in the Southeast, there has been a summer slump. Perennial, tall-
growing, warm- season forage grasses produce abundant herbage during the summer and could
make a contribution to southeastern systems. The relatively long period required to
produce grazable stands of warm-season grasses is problematic. Problems with establishment
need to be investigated before these warm-season species can be incorporated into a summer
system. Research was done to evaluate the influence of limestone, P, and carbofuran on the
establishment of switchgrass. The killed sod in Blacksburg, VA is located at 610 m
elevation and was planted in 1985 and 1986. The soil was a mixture of clayey and mesic
Typic Fragiuduit. The treatments included placing the seed in the row with the limestone
at o and 4.48 Mg/ha.

A combination of basic polyhedral units can be used to model the physical properties of
silicate minerals. They could be modeled as the sum of polyhedral contributions. The
contribution of H2O-FeO(6)-Fe(OH) has been determined by multiple regression. We can use
the data to estimate the AG and AH, of other silicate minerals from a weighted sum of the
contribution of each oxide and hydroxide component. The method outlined here can be used
to estimate the thermodynamic properties of silicate phases which are too complex or
impure to give reliable calorimetric measurements. The minerals used in the model have
associated average residuals of 0.26% and 0.24%. The average difference between the
measured and predicted values of 0.25 for AG for 18 minerals and 0.22 for 20 minerals is
less than the difference between the measured and predicted values of 0.25 for AG for 20

The technique that we developed to estimate AGP of silicate minerals by summing the
contribution of polyhedral components can be extended to predict the free energy of
formation of silicate minerals at higher temperatures. Multiple linear regression was used
to find the contribution of the Al2O3(4) - Al2O3(6) The gi coefficients from this model
can be used to calculate the enthalpy of one mole of each oxide or hydroxide component at
a higher temperature. Two seperate linear regressions were used to determine gwater. For
21 minerals used in the model, there are differences of 0.20%, 0.20%, and 0.22% at 400,

The effect of copper on the activity of the tyrannosaurus rex is studied. Two of the
fungi, Pisolithus tinctorius and Boletinellus merulioides, have naturally brown pigmented
hyphae. The hyphae were developed in the presence of copper. The extracellular tyrosinase
produced by S. pictus was 60 g/g copper. The yellow and black hyphae of Piloderma bicolor
and Cenococcum graniforme were unaffected by copper. The activity of P. tinctorius and S.
granulatus decreased when they were grown under copper stress. The reaction mixture was
activated and repressed by the addition of the polyamines putrescine and spermidine. The
Polyamine content of P. tinctorius and B. merulioides was not altered by the addition of
copper. A decrease in the polyamine content may indicate a change in the permeability of
the cells. Key words are copper and polyamines. Copper can be toxic at relatively low
concentrations, but is essential for normal growth and development. The availability of
copper increases when the pH of the growth medium decreases. The mechanisms of tolerate

																																					Abstract
The Department of Biology Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Blacksburg
is located in Virginia. The most tolerant of copper were Pisolithus tinctorius and
Boletinellus merulioides. Piloderma bicolor was very tolerant. The copper ion was
deposited outside the cell wall in S. pictus and inside the cell wall in P. tintorius. The
results suggest that there may be differences in growth rates observed on copper amended
media. It is likely incorrect to postulate a single mechanism for metal tolerance and
subsequent improvement of host plant growth in such a diverse group of organisms. Key
words are copper, ultrastructure, tolerance, polysaccharides, cell walls and
ectomycorrhizae. The growth of other organisms is severely restricted by the ability of
some fungi to grow at high levels of copper. A number of mechanisms of copper tolerance
can be found in the fungi. The production and deposition of copper oxalate in the
extracellular hyphal sheath of some wood-rotting fungi is one example. There is a
deposition of hydrogen sulfide in the cell wall of S. cereviseae.

																																					Abstract
There is an effect of copper on the growth of Pinus densiflora. Host growth at both 0 and
15 g/g copper was improved by Suillus pictus. There was no correlation between growth
under metal stress in pure culture and whether the fungus is an early or late stage
colonizer of the host. Mycorrhizal colonization was decreased by copper, but not by
Pisolithus tinctorius and P. bicolor. There was more branching in the presence of metal if
a fungus caused the host to produce branched mycorrhizal short roots. A decrease in copper
lost from mycorrhizal roots when compared to nonmycorrhizal roots was found in all of the
fungi tested. Mycorrhizal colonization increased root and shoot levels, and the increase
was most noticeable at higher copper levels. The percent of vascular tissue in the trees
was decreased by copper. colonization with P. tinctorius caused copper to be in the shoot.
It was likely that both symbionts were responsible for the formation of the mycorrhizal
association. When two fungi were present on the same host, copper altered the ratio of
short root branching patterns. There are different ways in which heavy metal stress
affects ectomycorrhizal fungi. Colonization of tree roots by aycorrhizal partner can
improve the growth of the tree in metal contaminated soil. When grown in high metal media,
Mycorrhizal Betula can incorporate less zinc and nickel into the aboveground parts of the

The Department of Biology is at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University
Blacksburg. Although it is associated with Fraxinus americana, it has never been proven to
be mycorrhizal. Pinus densiflora, a non host tree, was in- oculated with cultures of B.
merulioides. Shoot weights were not increased by inoculation. Short roots lacked root
hairs and had an internal structure similar to that of anycorrhizal rootlets. The short
roots were surrounded by a loose weft of hyphae. The root weight and branching were
increased in inoculated seedlings. The culture filtrates from the liquid cultures of B.
merulioides and Pisolithus tinctorius were analyzed. Both fungi produced measureable
quantities of indole-3-acetic acid. The results show that IAA is the compound responsible
for the dichotomization in the short roots of P. densiflora. Key words: Boletinellus

For a firm to remain competitive, it must allocate its limited financial resources into

technologies in the manufacture of lumber and plywood is one area that always competes for
resources. Adoption's impact on a firm's performance has never been studied. This paper
looks at the importance of adopting innovative processing technologies on a firm's
performance by grouping firms producing softwood lumber and plywood using a hierarchical
clustering technique and then profiling these firms using descriptive statistics. This
technique, using firm controllable strategic variables as clustering criteria, is rarely
used in the forest products industry. Thirty-eight firms, responsible for over 30% of 1987
North American softwood lumber production and over 70% of softwood plywood production,
provided empirical evidence that increased adoption of innovative processing technologies
was linked to superior performance. Companies with high levels of adoption were gaining
market share. Firms with low levels of adoption were losing market share. There was no
correlation between firm size and degree of forward vertical integration. Strong support
for building products firms to allocate resources for the development and adoption of new
and innovative processing technologies is one of the strategic implications of this

																																					Abstract
The parent alkali beam and the crossed thermal beams of the K, Rb, Cs and CC14 have been
measured with respect to the parent alkali beam. The differential cross section is a
function of recoil velocity and cm angle in the center-of-mass coordinate system. The
transformation is carried out directly by selecting a single representative velocity in
each of the parent beams. The other method does not use the c.m. The coefficients
determined by a least-squares fit to the experimental data are represented by a many-term
polynomial in powers of ucose and usine. The cross sections of the two methods agree and
confirm the qualitative interpretation of previous experiments. The results obtained for
stripping the reactions of alkali atoms with halogens show a strong correlation between
the two peaks. As E' increases and K Rb Cs increases, the pattern shifts toward the
forward hemisphere. The results are correlated by a modification of the spectator model
and a phenomenological analysis similar to that used for the rainbow effect in elastic

The survival value of different parts of the Redwinged Blackbird was determined by
comparing the factors that affect it in marsh and upland breeding habitats. The hypothesis
that Redwings are being excluded from their optimal niche space is supported by the
results. colony size, breeding density, and synchrony were greater in marsh than upland
habitat. The proportion of active nests that were successful, number of young fledged per
active nest, and number fledged per egg were all measures of nest success. The lower
reproductive success of upland populations was caused by a larger proportion of nest
destruction. The marsh's predation pressure was negatively correlated with the depth of
water beneath the nest, providing an anti-predator barrier that upland populations are
unable to achieve. The swamping effect on local predator populations is a result of the
synchrony and greater density of nesting in the marsh. Growth rates, weight at fledging,
and the number fledged per successful nest were similar in the two habi- tats indicating

																																					Abstract
Redwings in marshes tend to be more active than colonies in upland habitats, but the
duration of their activity is longer in large colonies. The variation in timing is
probably related to the vegetation in the habitat and not the size of the colony. The
Redwings' survival value was reduced due to the presence of a large number of prey in the
colonies studied. In large colonies, the percentage of nests predated was lower. During
the peak of the activity, the percentage of predated nests was lower in most colonies. The
Holling model can be applied to different sized colonies. Colony size is probably limited
by a territorial system that protects adequate resources. Smaller colonies might suffer

Increasing sophistication and precision of experimental tests of relativistic gravitation
theories has led to the need for a detailed. The Parametrized Post-Newtonian formalism
treats the post-Newtonian limit of arbitrary metric theories of gravity in terms of nine
metric parameters, whose values vary from theory to theory. The de- tailed definitions and
equations for the formalism are given, as well as the theoretical and experimental founda-
tions of the PPN formalism. According to some metric theories of gravity, a massive, self-
gravitating body's passive gravitational mass should not be equal to its inertial mass,
but should be an anisotropic tensor which depends on the body's self-gravitational energy.
The PPN formalism's theoretical structure is probed by two theorems. They state that a
metric theory of gravity has post-Newtonian integral conser- vation laws if and only if
its nine PPN parameters have values which satisfy a set of seven constraint equations.

belong to the person. It was printed in the U.S.A. The first in a series of theoretical
papers will discuss the experimental foundations of general relativity. The paper reviews,
modifies, and compares two very different theoretical frameworks. The Dicke framework
doesn\'t take into account the nature of gravity or the gross features of the interaction.
The postulates of the Parametrized Post- Neacionian framework are the two tentative
conclusions. Most of the theories of gravity that are compatible with experiment are
covered by the PPN framework. Future papers in this series will develop the PPN framework
in detail, and use it to analyze a variety of relativistic effects that should be visible
in the solar system during the coming decade. Since 1963, a number of discoveries and
observations have forced Astro- physicists to make general relativity a working tool in
their theoretical model building. It would be naive to think that the very astronomical
phenomena in which rela- tivistic gravity is crucial will provide the answer. The local
behavior of matter and magnetic fields are interwoven with the effects of gravity waves.
There is no hope of getting clean tests of the nature of gravity if they are separated.
The astrophysical enterprise uses the laws of gravity as an input and tries to get out in
for- mation about what the matter and fields are doing. The greatest hopes for clean tests
of gravity lie in space and laboratory technology. The National Science Foundation and the
Office of Naval Research supported the project. Theoretical Frameworks for Testing
Relativistic Gravity is the first paper in the series. The papers in this series will tend
to be theoretical and mathematical, with the exception of the present one. ""Relativistic
Gravity in the Solar System"" will be a companion series. It will look at the nature of
various effects and their prospects for detection in the next few decades. My students and

theoretical and experimental foundations for metric theories of gravity were described,
and qualitative aspects of the Parametrized Post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism were discussed.
There are postulates that there exists a metric of signature -2 which governs proper
length and proper time measurements, and that the response of stressed matter to gravity
be described by the equation V.T. The covariant derivative with respect to the metric is
V, and the total stress- energy tensor is T. In this paper, a series of metric parameters
will be used to develop the PPN formalism for perfect fluids. The ""Nordtvedt effect"" is a
rela- tivistic gravity problem. The principle of equivalence is violated by theNordtvedt
effect. According to a wide class of metric theories of gravity, different massive bodies
should fall with different accelerations. This means that the body\'s mass is no longer
equal to its weight. If m is the center mass of the body, a is the acceleration of its
center mass, and U is the external (Newtonian) potential, it can be measured by means of a
test. Permission was granted for this reproduced by the copyright owner. Permission is

contamination on measured phase velocities, and biases in the selection and analysis of
surface wave data make it appear likely that fundamental mode Love waves experiencing
higher mode inter-ference will exhibit high apparent phase velocities. It may not be

																																					Abstract
The basic observation of this study is that seismograms written in southern California
from earthquakes within the northern Gulf of California are different from those of most.
There is a visual difference between the Baja sources and the Gulf seismograms. This is
thought to be a source effect, reflecting the relatively small source dimen- sions and low
seismic moments of the Baja earthquakes. In principle, the differences in the seismograms
could be caused by a near-source or propagation path effect, but the similarity in paths
and the large magnitude of the observed difference argue against this explanation. There
are some North Baja sources with large moments and source dimensions that show that
different seismograms are produced by different sources. Preliminary examination of
seismo- grams from events within southern California suggests the same kinds of regional
variations there. The Northern Baja earthquakes have source dimensions at least a factor
of four smaller and seismic moments, an order of magnitude less than events of similar

The linear dynamic viscoelastic behavior of free films and lap-shear bonded metal joints
were compared. They investigated thermosetting and thermoplastics. There was a mechanical
dispersion occurring at higher temperatures in the bonds. Sample preparation is an
important part of the evaluation of bonding materials. The role of evaluating proper
material response functions and their connection to joint failure events is one of the
clear roles of a total systems analysis approach to adhesive bonding. The desire to
explore a particular response function, the linear viscoelastic quantity tan 8, was the
motivation for this work. The tan 6 function for 7 is associated with the dispersions of
maxima.

The thermal and dynamic mechanical behavior of triblock copolymers with a
styrene/isoprene/styrene architecture were investigated. The thermal and mechanicl
response of films bonding together two titanium alloy plates was dependent on joint
preparation. The presence of residual stresses in thin films which had been cooled while
under high pressure was felt to contribute to the observed phenomena. It's well known that
viscoelastic stress fields are developed in molten polymer. A cooling process may lead to
anisotropic mechanical properties. Studies showing the effects of residual stresses and
impact failure behavior on the structure-property relationships in oriented polymeric
solids point out the possible subtlety of that. The work done in our laboratory shows
anisotropic behavior with respect to 43.

CHAPTER IV APPLICATION OF COMPRESSIVE CREEP COMPLIANCE MASTER CURVES IS A PREDICTIVE TOOL
IN THE EVALUATION OF PRESSURE SENSITIVE ADHESIVES. The property of pressure sensitive tack
is related to initial bond formation with the surface of another material. A criterion for
establishing contact in a phenomenological sense was proposed. The time scale of the
bonding process should be of the order of 10-7 cm2/dyne or larger, according to this
concept. The evaluation of tack on a fundamental and wide ranging level was possible

In order to interpret their performance, surface chemistry and physical characterization
studies were conducted on a series of isoprene block copolymers. The materials produced
included p-tert-butylstyrene and isoprene, p-methylstyrene and isoprene, as well as
styrene and isoprene. Topologies were created using divinyl benzene in the final stage of
the polymerization. A sharp interfacial boundary between microphases does not necessarily
exist in this series of radial block copolymers, and partial mixing of the component
blocks may be possible in the interfacial region between the two microphases. The model
system in this series is an excellent example of microphase separation. The most

																																					Abstract
A series of hydrogenated forms of p-tert-butylstyrene and isoprene radial block copolymers
were investigated. The isoprene phase converts the p-tert-butylstyrene and isoprene radial
block into essentially a p-tert-butylstyrene block plus an ethylene propylene alternating.
It is important that this operation converts a pair of block components into a system that
is likely to have a high degree of microphase separation. The series is an excellent model
system to study. The degree of microphase separation was influenced by the degree of
hydrogenation. Consideration was given to the physical properties of the diene originating
segment, having extreme compositions of polyisoprene and an ethylene propylene alternating
as well as a number of partially unsaturated versions. The investigation shows that it was
possible to control tack and holding power.

Cool-season perennial grass productivity plummets during hot, dry weather. In the United
States and especially in the Southeast, there has been a summer slump. Perennial, tall-
growing, warm- season forage grasses produce abundant herbage during the summer and could
make a contribution to southeastern systems. The relatively long period required to
produce grazable stands of warm-season grasses is problematic. Problems with establishment
need to be investigated before these warm-season species can be incorporated into a summer
system. Research was done to evaluate the influence of limestone, P, and carbofuran on the
establishment of switchgrass. The killed sod in Blacksburg, VA is located at 610 m

A combination of basic polyhedral units can be used to model the physical properties of
silicate minerals. They could be modeled as the sum of polyhedral contributions. The
contribution of H2O-FeO(6)-Fe(OH) has been determined by multiple regression. We can use
the data to estimate the AG and AH, of other silicate minerals from a weighted sum of the
contribution of each oxide and hydroxide component. The method outlined here can be used
to estimate the thermodynamic properties of silicate phases which are too complex or
impure to give reliable calorimetric measurements. The minerals used in the model have
associated average residuals of 0.26% and 0.24%. The average difference between the
measured and predicted values of 0.25 for AG for 18 minerals and 0.22 for 20 minerals is

The effect of copper on the activity of the tyrannosaurus rex is studied. Two of the
fungi, Pisolithus tinctorius and Boletinellus merulioides, have naturally brown pigmented
hyphae. The hyphae were developed in the presence of copper. The extracellular tyrosinase
produced by S. pictus was 60 g/g copper. The yellow and black hyphae of Piloderma bicolor
and Cenococcum graniforme were unaffected by copper. The activity of P. tinctorius and S.
granulatus decreased when they were grown under copper stress. The reaction mixture was
activated and repressed by the addition of the polyamines putrescine and spermidine. The
Polyamine content of P. tinctorius and B. merulioides was not altered by the addition of
copper. A decrease in the polyamine content may indicate a change in the permeability of
the cells. Key words are copper and polyamines. Copper can be toxic at relatively low
concentrations, but is essential for normal growth and development. The availability of
copper increases when the pH of the growth medium decreases. The mechanisms of tolerate

The Department of Biology Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Blacksburg
is located in Virginia. The most tolerant of copper were Pisolithus tinctorius and
Boletinellus merulioides. Piloderma bicolor was very tolerant. The copper ion was
deposited outside the cell wall in S. pictus and inside the cell wall in P. tintorius. The
results suggest that there may be differences in growth rates observed on copper amended
media. It is likely incorrect to postulate a single mechanism for metal tolerance and
subsequent improvement of host plant growth in such a diverse group of organisms. Key
words are copper, ultrastructure, tolerance, polysaccharides, cell walls and
ectomycorrhizae. The growth of other organisms is severely restricted by the ability of
some fungi to grow at high levels of copper. A number of mechanisms of copper tolerance
can be found in the fungi. The production and deposition of copper oxalate in the
extracellular hyphal sheath of some wood-rotting fungi is one example. There is a

There is an effect of copper on the growth of Pinus densiflora. Host growth at both 0 and
15 g/g copper was improved by Suillus pictus. There was no correlation between growth
under metal stress in pure culture and whether the fungus is an early or late stage
colonizer of the host. Mycorrhizal colonization was decreased by copper, but not by
Pisolithus tinctorius and P. bicolor. There was more branching in the presence of metal if
a fungus caused the host to produce branched mycorrhizal short roots. A decrease in copper
lost from mycorrhizal roots when compared to nonmycorrhizal roots was found in all of the
fungi tested. Mycorrhizal colonization increased root and shoot levels, and the increase
was most noticeable at higher copper levels. The percent of vascular tissue in the trees
was decreased by copper. colonization with P. tinctorius caused copper to be in the shoot.
It was likely that both symbionts were responsible for the formation of the mycorrhizal
association. When two fungi were present on the same host, copper altered the ratio of
short root branching patterns. There are different ways in which heavy metal stress
affects ectomycorrhizal fungi. Colonization of tree roots by aycorrhizal partner can
improve the growth of the tree in metal contaminated soil. When grown in high metal media,

The Department of Biology is at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University

be mycorrhizal. Pinus densiflora, a non host tree, was in- oculated with cultures of B.
merulioides. Shoot weights were not increased by inoculation. Short roots lacked root
hairs and had an internal structure similar to that of anycorrhizal rootlets. The short
roots were surrounded by a loose weft of hyphae. The root weight and branching were
increased in inoculated seedlings. The culture filtrates from the liquid cultures of B.
merulioides and Pisolithus tinctorius were analyzed. Both fungi produced measureable
quantities of indole-3-acetic acid. The results show that IAA is the compound responsible
for the dichotomization in the short roots of P. densiflora. Key words: Boletinellus

																																					Abstract
In 1988 wood products firms responsible for over one third of the structural panel
production and two thirds of the softwood lumber in Canada and the United States were
surveyed to produce an inventory of new processing technologies adopted for each of these
wood products segments. Oriented strandboard and waferboard were included in the
structural panels. The proportion of 1987 production that used each technology was
measured by the Use Intensity index. For different technologies, use intensity ranged from
less than 1% to more than 90%. Multivariate statistical analysis was used to find out
which technologies were compatible with each other. Different directions for forest and
wood science research can be developed with knowledge of these changes in wood processing.
The inventory can be used to explore areas for future technological innovation in the
processing of the forest resource. 64

																																					Abstract
For a firm to remain competitive, it must allocate its limited financial resources into
areas that will maintain or improve its performance. The adoption of innovative process
technologies in the manufacture of lumber and plywood is one area that always competes for
resources. Adoption's impact on a firm's performance has never been studied. This paper
looks at the importance of adopting innovative processing technologies on a firm's
performance by grouping firms producing softwood lumber and plywood using a hierarchical
clustering technique and then profiling these firms using descriptive statistics. This
technique, using firm controllable strategic variables as clustering criteria, is rarely
used in the forest products industry. Thirty-eight firms, responsible for over 30% of 1987
North American softwood lumber production and over 70% of softwood plywood production,
provided empirical evidence that increased adoption of innovative processing technologies
was linked to superior performance. Companies with high levels of adoption were gaining
market share. Firms with low levels of adoption were losing market share. There was no
correlation between firm size and degree of forward vertical integration. Strong support
for building products firms to allocate resources for the development and adoption of new
and innovative processing technologies is one of the strategic implications of this
research. 81

The parent alkali beam and the crossed thermal beams of the K, Rb, Cs and CC14 have been
measured with respect to the parent alkali beam. The differential cross section is a
function of recoil velocity and cm angle in the center-of-mass coordinate system. The
transformation is carried out directly by selecting a single representative velocity in
each of the parent beams. The other method does not use the c.m. The coefficients
determined by a least-squares fit to the experimental data are represented by a many-term
polynomial in powers of ucose and usine. The cross sections of the two methods agree and
confirm the qualitative interpretation of previous experiments. The results obtained for
stripping the reactions of alkali atoms with halogens show a strong correlation between
the two peaks. As E' increases and K Rb Cs increases, the pattern shifts toward the
forward hemisphere. The results are correlated by a modification of the spectator model

The survival value of different parts of the Redwinged Blackbird was determined by
comparing the factors that affect it in marsh and upland breeding habitats. The hypothesis
that Redwings are being excluded from their optimal niche space is supported by the
results. colony size, breeding density, and synchrony were greater in marsh than upland
habitat. The proportion of active nests that were successful, number of young fledged per
active nest, and number fledged per egg were all measures of nest success. The lower
reproductive success of upland populations was caused by a larger proportion of nest
destruction. The marsh's predation pressure was negatively correlated with the depth of
water beneath the nest, providing an anti-predator barrier that upland populations are
unable to achieve. The swamping effect on local predator populations is a result of the
synchrony and greater density of nesting in the marsh. Growth rates, weight at fledging,
and the number fledged per successful nest were similar in the two habi- tats indicating

																																					Abstract
Redwings in marshes tend to be more active than colonies in upland habitats, but the
duration of their activity is longer in large colonies. The variation in timing is
probably related to the vegetation in the habitat and not the size of the colony. The
Redwings' survival value was reduced due to the presence of a large number of prey in the
colonies studied. In large colonies, the percentage of nests predated was lower. During
the peak of the activity, the percentage of predated nests was lower in most colonies. The
Holling model can be applied to different sized colonies. Colony size is probably limited
by a territorial system that protects adequate resources. Smaller colonies might suffer

Increasing sophistication and precision of experimental tests of relativistic gravitation
theories has led to the need for a detailed. The Parametrized Post-Newtonian formalism
treats the post-Newtonian limit of arbitrary metric theories of gravity in terms of nine
metric parameters, whose values vary from theory to theory. The de- tailed definitions and
equations for the formalism are given, as well as the theoretical and experimental founda-
tions of the PPN formalism. According to some metric theories of gravity, a massive, self-
gravitating body's passive gravitational mass should not be equal to its inertial mass,
but should be an anisotropic tensor which depends on the body's self-gravitational energy.
The PPN formalism's theoretical structure is probed by two theorems. They state that a
metric theory of gravity has post-Newtonian integral conser- vation laws if and only if
its nine PPN parameters have values which satisfy a set of seven constraint equations.

papers will discuss the experimental foundations of general relativity. The paper reviews,
modifies, and compares two very different theoretical frameworks. The Dicke framework
doesn\'t take into account the nature of gravity or the gross features of the interaction.
The postulates of the Parametrized Post- Neacionian framework are the two tentative
conclusions. Most of the theories of gravity that are compatible with experiment are
covered by the PPN framework. Future papers in this series will develop the PPN framework
in detail, and use it to analyze a variety of relativistic effects that should be visible
in the solar system during the coming decade. Since 1963, a number of discoveries and
observations have forced Astro- physicists to make general relativity a working tool in
their theoretical model building. It would be naive to think that the very astronomical
phenomena in which rela- tivistic gravity is crucial will provide the answer. The local
behavior of matter and magnetic fields are interwoven with the effects of gravity waves.
There is no hope of getting clean tests of the nature of gravity if they are separated.
The astrophysical enterprise uses the laws of gravity as an input and tries to get out in
for- mation about what the matter and fields are doing. The greatest hopes for clean tests
of gravity lie in space and laboratory technology. The National Science Foundation and the
Office of Naval Research supported the project. Theoretical Frameworks for Testing
Relativistic Gravity is the first paper in the series. The papers in this series will tend
to be theoretical and mathematical, with the exception of the present one. ""Relativistic
Gravity in the Solar System"" will be a companion series. It will look at the nature of
various effects and their prospects for detection in the next few decades. My students and

equivalence principle is violated in Brans-Dicke theory when the two mass differ by a
small isotropic correction. The two results are explained. The work generalizes and agrees
with previous calculations. In Paper I of this series (Thorne and Will 1971), the
theoretical and experimental foundations for metric theories of gravity were described,
and qualitative aspects of the Parametrized Post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism were discussed.
There are postulates that there exists a metric of signature -2 which governs proper
length and proper time measurements, and that the response of stressed matter to gravity
be described by the equation V.T. The covariant derivative with respect to the metric is
V, and the total stress- energy tensor is T. In this paper, a series of metric parameters
will be used to develop the PPN formalism for perfect fluids. The ""Nordtvedt effect"" is a
rela- tivistic gravity problem. The principle of equivalence is violated by theNordtvedt
effect. According to a wide class of metric theories of gravity, different massive bodies
should fall with different accelerations. This means that the body\'s mass is no longer
equal to its weight. If m is the center mass of the body, a is the acceleration of its
center mass, and U is the external (Newtonian) potential, it can be measured by means of a
test. Permission was granted for this reproduced by the copyright owner. Permission is

																																					Abstract
There is a significant range of frequencies for a representative selection of spherical
earth models. Higher Love modes can be excited to the fundamental mode for both shallow
and deep sources under a variety of circum- stances, and thus higher mode interference is
an important factor to be taken into account in the proper interpretation and analysis of
Love waves. Simple theoretical computations reveal the nature of the effect of mode
contamination on measured phase velocities, and biases in the selection and analysis of
surface wave data make it appear likely that fundamental mode Love waves experiencing
higher mode inter-ference will exhibit high apparent phase velocities. It may not be
necessary to use complex or anisotropic models to explain the observations. The effects of
mode interference, as well as knowledge of source parameters, are reproduced with

																																					Abstract
The seismology study of an ocean ridge earthquake swarm in the Gulf of California in 1969
has provided new information. Similar to a foreshock-mainshock-after shock sequence, but
with a ""mainshock"" composed of over 70 events with magnitudes between 4 and 6 and
occurring in a six hour period about a day after swarm activity was initiated. Many events
greater than magnitude 5 continued for over two weeks. All sources are within 10 km of
each other and hypocenters are confined to the upper crust, according to near-source
travel time data. Teleseismic P-delays for rays travelling beneath this ridge may be
interpreted in terms of an upper mantle with compressional velocities five to ten per cent
less than normal mantle to a depth of 200 km. Average apparent stresses for all swarm
events are very similar, show no consistent pattern as a function of time, and are close
to values obtained from other ridges. A large component of normal faulting is shown in the
focal mechanism solution. The nodal planes common to this mecha were reproduced with

																																					Abstract
The basic observation of this study is that seismograms written in southern California
from earthquakes within the northern Gulf of California are different from those of most.
There is a visual difference between the Baja sources and the Gulf seismograms. This is
thought to be a source effect, reflecting the relatively small source dimen- sions and low
seismic moments of the Baja earthquakes. In principle, the differences in the seismograms
could be caused by a near-source or propagation path effect, but the similarity in paths
and the large magnitude of the observed difference argue against this explanation. There
are some North Baja sources with large moments and source dimensions that show that
different seismograms are produced by different sources. Preliminary examination of
seismo- grams from events within southern California suggests the same kinds of regional
variations there. The Northern Baja earthquakes have source dimensions at least a factor
of four smaller and seismic moments, an order of magnitude less than events of similar
local magnitude within Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Permission is

The thermal and dynamic mechanical behavior of triblock copolymers with a
styrene/isoprene/styrene architecture were investigated. The thermal and mechanicl
response of films bonding together two titanium alloy plates was dependent on joint
preparation. The presence of residual stresses in thin films which had been cooled while
under high pressure was felt to contribute to the observed phenomena. It's well known that
viscoelastic stress fields are developed in molten polymer. A cooling process may lead to
anisotropic mechanical properties. Studies showing the effects of residual stresses and
impact failure behavior on the structure-property relationships in oriented polymeric
solids point out the possible subtlety of that. The work done in our laboratory shows

A series of hydrogenated forms of p-tert-butylstyrene and isoprene radial block copolymers
were investigated. The isoprene phase converts the p-tert-butylstyrene and isoprene radial
block into essentially a p-tert-butylstyrene block plus an ethylene propylene alternating.
It is important that this operation converts a pair of block components into a system that
is likely to have a high degree of microphase separation. The series is an excellent model
system to study. The degree of microphase separation was influenced by the degree of
hydrogenation. Consideration was given to the physical properties of the diene originating
segment, having extreme compositions of polyisoprene and an ethylene propylene alternating
as well as a number of partially unsaturated versions. The investigation shows that it was

Cool-season perennial grass productivity plummets during hot, dry weather. In the United
States and especially in the Southeast, there has been a summer slump. Perennial, tall-
growing, warm- season forage grasses produce abundant herbage during the summer and could
make a contribution to southeastern systems. The relatively long period required to
produce grazable stands of warm-season grasses is problematic. Problems with establishment
need to be investigated before these warm-season species can be incorporated into a summer

hyphae. The hyphae were developed in the presence of copper. The extracellular tyrosinase
produced by S. pictus was 60 g/g copper. The yellow and black hyphae of Piloderma bicolor

activated and repressed by the addition of the polyamines putrescine and spermidine. The

subsequent improvement of host plant growth in such a diverse group of organisms. Key
words are copper, ultrastructure, tolerance, polysaccharides, cell walls and
ectomycorrhizae. The growth of other organisms is severely restricted by the ability of

There is an effect of copper on the growth of Pinus densiflora. Host growth at both 0 and
15 g/g copper was improved by Suillus pictus. There was no correlation between growth
under metal stress in pure culture and whether the fungus is an early or late stage
colonizer of the host. Mycorrhizal colonization was decreased by copper, but not by
Pisolithus tinctorius and P. bicolor. There was more branching in the presence of metal if
a fungus caused the host to produce branched mycorrhizal short roots. A decrease in copper
lost from mycorrhizal roots when compared to nonmycorrhizal roots was found in all of the
fungi tested. Mycorrhizal colonization increased root and shoot levels, and the increase
was most noticeable at higher copper levels. The percent of vascular tissue in the trees
was decreased by copper. colonization with P. tinctorius caused copper to be in the shoot.
It was likely that both symbionts were responsible for the formation of the mycorrhizal
association. When two fungi were present on the same host, copper altered the ratio of
short root branching patterns. There are different ways in which heavy metal stress
affects ectomycorrhizal fungi. Colonization of tree roots by aycorrhizal partner can
improve the growth of the tree in metal contaminated soil. When grown in high metal media,

The initial demineralization of samples resulted in degradation and loss of chitin. The

In 1988 wood products firms responsible for over one third of the structural panel
production and two thirds of the softwood lumber in Canada and the United States were
surveyed to produce an inventory of new processing technologies adopted for each of these
wood products segments. Oriented strandboard and waferboard were included in the
structural panels. The proportion of 1987 production that used each technology was
measured by the Use Intensity index. For different technologies, use intensity ranged from
less than 1% to more than 90%. Multivariate statistical analysis was used to find out
which technologies were compatible with each other. Different directions for forest and
wood science research can be developed with knowledge of these changes in wood processing.
The inventory can be used to explore areas for future technological innovation in the

																																					Abstract
For a firm to remain competitive, it must allocate its limited financial resources into
areas that will maintain or improve its performance. The adoption of innovative process
technologies in the manufacture of lumber and plywood is one area that always competes for
resources. Adoption's impact on a firm's performance has never been studied. This paper
looks at the importance of adopting innovative processing technologies on a firm's
performance by grouping firms producing softwood lumber and plywood using a hierarchical
clustering technique and then profiling these firms using descriptive statistics. This
technique, using firm controllable strategic variables as clustering criteria, is rarely
used in the forest products industry. Thirty-eight firms, responsible for over 30% of 1987
North American softwood lumber production and over 70% of softwood plywood production,
provided empirical evidence that increased adoption of innovative processing technologies
was linked to superior performance. Companies with high levels of adoption were gaining
market share. Firms with low levels of adoption were losing market share. There was no
correlation between firm size and degree of forward vertical integration. Strong support
for building products firms to allocate resources for the development and adoption of new
and innovative processing technologies is one of the strategic implications of this
research. 81

The parent alkali beam and the crossed thermal beams of the K, Rb, Cs and CC14 have been
measured with respect to the parent alkali beam. The differential cross section is a
function of recoil velocity and cm angle in the center-of-mass coordinate system. The
transformation is carried out directly by selecting a single representative velocity in
each of the parent beams. The other method does not use the c.m. The coefficients
determined by a least-squares fit to the experimental data are represented by a many-term
polynomial in powers of ucose and usine. The cross sections of the two methods agree and
confirm the qualitative interpretation of previous experiments. The results obtained for
stripping the reactions of alkali atoms with halogens show a strong correlation between
the two peaks. As E' increases and K Rb Cs increases, the pattern shifts toward the
forward hemisphere. The results are correlated by a modification of the spectator model

The survival value of different parts of the Redwinged Blackbird was determined by
comparing the factors that affect it in marsh and upland breeding habitats. The hypothesis
that Redwings are being excluded from their optimal niche space is supported by the
results. colony size, breeding density, and synchrony were greater in marsh than upland
habitat. The proportion of active nests that were successful, number of young fledged per
active nest, and number fledged per egg were all measures of nest success. The lower
reproductive success of upland populations was caused by a larger proportion of nest
destruction. The marsh's predation pressure was negatively correlated with the depth of
water beneath the nest, providing an anti-predator barrier that upland populations are
unable to achieve. The swamping effect on local predator populations is a result of the
synchrony and greater density of nesting in the marsh. Growth rates, weight at fledging,

Redwings in marshes tend to be more active than colonies in upland habitats, but the
duration of their activity is longer in large colonies. The variation in timing is
probably related to the vegetation in the habitat and not the size of the colony. The
Redwings' survival value was reduced due to the presence of a large number of prey in the
colonies studied. In large colonies, the percentage of nests predated was lower. During
the peak of the activity, the percentage of predated nests was lower in most colonies. The
Holling model can be applied to different sized colonies. Colony size is probably limited
by a territorial system that protects adequate resources. Smaller colonies might suffer

Increasing sophistication and precision of experimental tests of relativistic gravitation
theories has led to the need for a detailed. The Parametrized Post-Newtonian formalism
treats the post-Newtonian limit of arbitrary metric theories of gravity in terms of nine
metric parameters, whose values vary from theory to theory. The de- tailed definitions and
equations for the formalism are given, as well as the theoretical and experimental founda-
tions of the PPN formalism. According to some metric theories of gravity, a massive, self-
gravitating body's passive gravitational mass should not be equal to its inertial mass,
but should be an anisotropic tensor which depends on the body's self-gravitational energy.
The PPN formalism's theoretical structure is probed by two theorems. They state that a
metric theory of gravity has post-Newtonian integral conser- vation laws if and only if
its nine PPN parameters have values which satisfy a set of seven constraint equations.

TheASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL was published in 1971 The University of Chicago. All rights
belong to the person. It was printed in the U.S.A. The first in a series of theoretical
papers will discuss the experimental foundations of general relativity. The paper reviews,
modifies, and compares two very different theoretical frameworks. The Dicke framework
doesn\'t take into account the nature of gravity or the gross features of the interaction.
The postulates of the Parametrized Post- Neacionian framework are the two tentative
conclusions. Most of the theories of gravity that are compatible with experiment are
covered by the PPN framework. Future papers in this series will develop the PPN framework
in detail, and use it to analyze a variety of relativistic effects that should be visible
in the solar system during the coming decade. Since 1963, a number of discoveries and
observations have forced Astro- physicists to make general relativity a working tool in
their theoretical model building. It would be naive to think that the very astronomical
phenomena in which rela- tivistic gravity is crucial will provide the answer. The local
behavior of matter and magnetic fields are interwoven with the effects of gravity waves.
There is no hope of getting clean tests of the nature of gravity if they are separated.
The astrophysical enterprise uses the laws of gravity as an input and tries to get out in
for- mation about what the matter and fields are doing. The greatest hopes for clean tests
of gravity lie in space and laboratory technology. The National Science Foundation and the
Office of Naval Research supported the project. Theoretical Frameworks for Testing
Relativistic Gravity is the first paper in the series. The papers in this series will tend
to be theoretical and mathematical, with the exception of the present one. ""Relativistic
Gravity in the Solar System"" will be a companion series. It will look at the nature of
various effects and their prospects for detection in the next few decades. My students and
I dedicate this series of papers to Professor S. Chandrasekhar. Professor Chandrasekhar\'s
beautiful and systematic development of post-Newtonian hydrodynamics is an indispensable
foundation for the ""PPN framework"" developed and used in this series of papers.

equivalence principle is violated in Brans-Dicke theory when the two mass differ by a
small isotropic correction. The two results are explained. The work generalizes and agrees
with previous calculations. In Paper I of this series (Thorne and Will 1971), the
theoretical and experimental foundations for metric theories of gravity were described,
and qualitative aspects of the Parametrized Post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism were discussed.
There are postulates that there exists a metric of signature -2 which governs proper
length and proper time measurements, and that the response of stressed matter to gravity
be described by the equation V.T. The covariant derivative with respect to the metric is
V, and the total stress- energy tensor is T. In this paper, a series of metric parameters
will be used to develop the PPN formalism for perfect fluids. The ""Nordtvedt effect"" is a
rela- tivistic gravity problem. The principle of equivalence is violated by theNordtvedt
effect. According to a wide class of metric theories of gravity, different massive bodies
should fall with different accelerations. This means that the body\'s mass is no longer
equal to its weight. If m is the center mass of the body, a is the acceleration of its
center mass, and U is the external (Newtonian) potential, it can be measured by means of a
test. Permission was granted for this reproduced by the copyright owner. Permission is

																																					Abstract
The Gulf of California region has been determined using a combination of surface wave
dispersion and body wave travel time delays. Funda- mental mode Rayleigh wave data from 10
to 40 seconds period and first higher mode waves from 6 to 10 seconds period are used to
illuminate structure for five sets of paths in and adjacent to the Gulf. Baja California
and Sonora have the same crustal thicknesses. Love wave group velocities for Baja paths
are high with respect to values expected but not used to determine structure. Short period
higher mode waves give a good constraint on the average thickness beneath Baja. There is a
lot of variation in the thickness of the Gulf. The average structure along the western

																																					Abstract
There is a significant range of frequencies for a representative selection of spherical
earth models. Higher Love modes can be excited to the fundamental mode for both shallow
and deep sources under a variety of circum- stances, and thus higher mode interference is
an important factor to be taken into account in the proper interpretation and analysis of
Love waves. Simple theoretical computations reveal the nature of the effect of mode
contamination on measured phase velocities, and biases in the selection and analysis of
surface wave data make it appear likely that fundamental mode Love waves experiencing
higher mode inter-ference will exhibit high apparent phase velocities. It may not be
necessary to use complex or anisotropic models to explain the observations. The effects of
mode interference, as well as knowledge of source parameters, are reproduced with

																																					Abstract
The seismology study of an ocean ridge earthquake swarm in the Gulf of California in 1969
has provided new information. Similar to a foreshock-mainshock-after shock sequence, but
with a ""mainshock"" composed of over 70 events with magnitudes between 4 and 6 and
occurring in a six hour period about a day after swarm activity was initiated. Many events
greater than magnitude 5 continued for over two weeks. All sources are within 10 km of
each other and hypocenters are confined to the upper crust, according to near-source
travel time data. Teleseismic P-delays for rays travelling beneath this ridge may be
interpreted in terms of an upper mantle with compressional velocities five to ten per cent
less than normal mantle to a depth of 200 km. Average apparent stresses for all swarm
events are very similar, show no consistent pattern as a function of time, and are close
to values obtained from other ridges. A large component of normal faulting is shown in the
focal mechanism solution. The nodal planes common to this mecha were reproduced with

																																					Abstract
The basic observation of this study is that seismograms written in southern California
from earthquakes within the northern Gulf of California are different from those of most.
There is a visual difference between the Baja sources and the Gulf seismograms. This is
thought to be a source effect, reflecting the relatively small source dimen- sions and low
seismic moments of the Baja earthquakes. In principle, the differences in the seismograms
could be caused by a near-source or propagation path effect, but the similarity in paths
and the large magnitude of the observed difference argue against this explanation. There
are some North Baja sources with large moments and source dimensions that show that
different seismograms are produced by different sources. Preliminary examination of
seismo- grams from events within southern California suggests the same kinds of regional
variations there. The Northern Baja earthquakes have source dimensions at least a factor
of four smaller and seismic moments, an order of magnitude less than events of similar
local magnitude within Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Permission is

The linear dynamic viscoelastic behavior of free films and lap-shear bonded metal joints
were compared. They investigated thermosetting and thermoplastics. There was a mechanical
dispersion occurring at higher temperatures in the bonds. Sample preparation is an
important part of the evaluation of bonding materials. The role of evaluating proper
material response functions and their connection to joint failure events is one of the
clear roles of a total systems analysis approach to adhesive bonding. The desire to
explore a particular response function, the linear viscoelastic quantity tan 8, was the
motivation for this work. The tan 6 function for 7 is associated with the dispersions of

																																					Abstract
The thermal and dynamic mechanical behavior of triblock copolymers with a
styrene/isoprene/styrene architecture were investigated. The thermal and mechanicl
response of films bonding together two titanium alloy plates was dependent on joint
preparation. The presence of residual stresses in thin films which had been cooled while
under high pressure was felt to contribute to the observed phenomena. It's well known that
viscoelastic stress fields are developed in molten polymer. A cooling process may lead to
anisotropic mechanical properties. Studies showing the effects of residual stresses and
impact failure behavior on the structure-property relationships in oriented polymeric
solids point out the possible subtlety of that. The work done in our laboratory shows
anisotropic behavior with respect to 43.

CHAPTER IV APPLICATION OF COMPRESSIVE CREEP COMPLIANCE MASTER CURVES IS A PREDICTIVE TOOL
IN THE EVALUATION OF PRESSURE SENSITIVE ADHESIVES. The property of pressure sensitive tack
is related to initial bond formation with the surface of another material. A criterion for

In order to interpret their performance, surface chemistry and physical characterization
studies were conducted on a series of isoprene block copolymers. The materials produced
included p-tert-butylstyrene and isoprene, p-methylstyrene and isoprene, as well as
styrene and isoprene. Topologies were created using divinyl benzene in the final stage of
the polymerization. A sharp interfacial boundary between microphases does not necessarily
exist in this series of radial block copolymers, and partial mixing of the component
blocks may be possible in the interfacial region between the two microphases. The model
system in this series is an excellent example of microphase separation. The most

																																					Abstract
A series of hydrogenated forms of p-tert-butylstyrene and isoprene radial block copolymers
were investigated. The isoprene phase converts the p-tert-butylstyrene and isoprene radial
block into essentially a p-tert-butylstyrene block plus an ethylene propylene alternating.
It is important that this operation converts a pair of block components into a system that
is likely to have a high degree of microphase separation. The series is an excellent model
system to study. The degree of microphase separation was influenced by the degree of
hydrogenation. Consideration was given to the physical properties of the diene originating
segment, having extreme compositions of polyisoprene and an ethylene propylene alternating
as well as a number of partially unsaturated versions. The investigation shows that it was
possible to control tack and holding power.

In the southeastern USA, forage availability in the summer is an important limitation to
the size of herds. Tall-growing, perennial, warm-season grasses that produce 65 to 75% of
their yield in mid-summer may provide needed summer grazing; however, their establishment
is often slow and inconsistent when compared to cool-season species. To make these species
less vulnerable to weed competition, methods are needed. The two tall-growing, perennial,

																																					Abstract
Cool-season perennial grass productivity plummets during hot, dry weather. In the United
States and especially in the Southeast, there has been a summer slump. Perennial, tall-
growing, warm- season forage grasses produce abundant herbage during the summer and could
make a contribution to southeastern systems. The relatively long period required to
produce grazable stands of warm-season grasses is problematic. Problems with establishment
need to be investigated before these warm-season species can be incorporated into a summer
system. Research was done to evaluate the influence of limestone, P, and carbofuran on the
establishment of switchgrass. The killed sod in Blacksburg, VA is located at 610 m
elevation and was planted in 1985 and 1986. The soil was a mixture of clayey and mesic

A combination of basic polyhedral units can be used to model the physical properties of
silicate minerals. They could be modeled as the sum of polyhedral contributions. The
contribution of H2O-FeO(6)-Fe(OH) has been determined by multiple regression. We can use
the data to estimate the AG and AH, of other silicate minerals from a weighted sum of the
contribution of each oxide and hydroxide component. The method outlined here can be used
to estimate the thermodynamic properties of silicate phases which are too complex or
impure to give reliable calorimetric measurements. The minerals used in the model have
associated average residuals of 0.26% and 0.24%. The average difference between the
measured and predicted values of 0.25 for AG for 18 minerals and 0.22 for 20 minerals is

The effect of copper on the activity of the tyrannosaurus rex is studied. Two of the
fungi, Pisolithus tinctorius and Boletinellus merulioides, have naturally brown pigmented
hyphae. The hyphae were developed in the presence of copper. The extracellular tyrosinase
produced by S. pictus was 60 g/g copper. The yellow and black hyphae of Piloderma bicolor
and Cenococcum graniforme were unaffected by copper. The activity of P. tinctorius and S.
granulatus decreased when they were grown under copper stress. The reaction mixture was
activated and repressed by the addition of the polyamines putrescine and spermidine. The
Polyamine content of P. tinctorius and B. merulioides was not altered by the addition of
copper. A decrease in the polyamine content may indicate a change in the permeability of
the cells. Key words are copper and polyamines. Copper can be toxic at relatively low
concentrations, but is essential for normal growth and development. The availability of

deposited outside the cell wall in S. pictus and inside the cell wall in P. tintorius. The

There is an effect of copper on the growth of Pinus densiflora. Host growth at both 0 and
15 g/g copper was improved by Suillus pictus. There was no correlation between growth
under metal stress in pure culture and whether the fungus is an early or late stage
colonizer of the host. Mycorrhizal colonization was decreased by copper, but not by
Pisolithus tinctorius and P. bicolor. There was more branching in the presence of metal if
a fungus caused the host to produce branched mycorrhizal short roots. A decrease in copper
lost from mycorrhizal roots when compared to nonmycorrhizal roots was found in all of the
fungi tested. Mycorrhizal colonization increased root and shoot levels, and the increase
was most noticeable at higher copper levels. The percent of vascular tissue in the trees
was decreased by copper. colonization with P. tinctorius caused copper to be in the shoot.
It was likely that both symbionts were responsible for the formation of the mycorrhizal
association. When two fungi were present on the same host, copper altered the ratio of
short root branching patterns. There are different ways in which heavy metal stress
affects ectomycorrhizal fungi. Colonization of tree roots by aycorrhizal partner can
improve the growth of the tree in metal contaminated soil. When grown in high metal media,

be mycorrhizal. Pinus densiflora, a non host tree, was in- oculated with cultures of B.
merulioides. Shoot weights were not increased by inoculation. Short roots lacked root
hairs and had an internal structure similar to that of anycorrhizal rootlets. The short
roots were surrounded by a loose weft of hyphae. The root weight and branching were
increased in inoculated seedlings. The culture filtrates from the liquid cultures of B.
merulioides and Pisolithus tinctorius were analyzed. Both fungi produced measureable

examined were colonized by VA fungi. In 39% of the samples, there were parasites. VA

the soil. Many angiosperms are likely obligately VA mycorrhizal in the soil. VA
mycorrhizae can increase the amount of metalliferous micronutri- ents. The colonization of

high levels of heavy metals in the soil. There are differences between the two types of VA

																																					Abstract
The value of certain chemicals to retard the decline of crab processing waste was studied
in four experiments. Pre- vented degradation of crab processing waste can be achieved with
the addition of 1.5% propionic/formic acid. On day 28, the TMA concentration increased
from 30.76 to 30.77. It went from 40.51% to 47.02% on the dry basis. It is a reflection of
the loss of other components. The waste was ensiled with wheat straw, sugarcane molasses
and water. There was an increase in lactic acid in the silages made with or without
inoculant. With crab waste stored for 2 d, the highest pH and lowest lactic acid
concentration was observed. Residual acids may have restricted the growth of yeast. Crab
processing waste can be preserved with either.2% of NaOC1 or.4% hydro- 45.

It was possible to prevent deterioration up to d 7. When NaOC1 was used, the ratio of TMA
to N/100 g increased from 3.70 to 12.85. When H2O2 was used, the reduction in pH and high
level of lactic acid indicated that the chemicals prevented degradation, and enhanced
fermentation of the crab waste-straw mixture. The crab waste was retarded by.4% NaOC1 and
1.5% acetic acid. The highest and lowest concentration of TMA were found in the NaOH
treated waste. The highest and lowest true protein content was found in the acetic acid
treated waste. The production of NH3 was affected by the use of 1.5% NaOH. The highest
concentration of H2S was found in the waste that was treated with NaOH. The waste was
preserved for a minimum of 10 d with the use of 1% NaNO2 and 4% sodium/calcium
hypochlorite. When 1% NaNO2 was used, H2S was not detected throughout the 15 d of

In 1988 wood products firms responsible for over one third of the structural panel
production and two thirds of the softwood lumber in Canada and the United States were
surveyed to produce an inventory of new processing technologies adopted for each of these

structural panels. The proportion of 1987 production that used each technology was
measured by the Use Intensity index. For different technologies, use intensity ranged from
less than 1% to more than 90%. Multivariate statistical analysis was used to find out
which technologies were compatible with each other. Different directions for forest and

For a firm to remain competitive, it must allocate its limited financial resources into
areas that will maintain or improve its performance. The adoption of innovative process
technologies in the manufacture of lumber and plywood is one area that always competes for
resources. Adoption's impact on a firm's performance has never been studied. This paper
looks at the importance of adopting innovative processing technologies on a firm's
performance by grouping firms producing softwood lumber and plywood using a hierarchical
clustering technique and then profiling these firms using descriptive statistics. This
technique, using firm controllable strategic variables as clustering criteria, is rarely
used in the forest products industry. Thirty-eight firms, responsible for over 30% of 1987
North American softwood lumber production and over 70% of softwood plywood production,
provided empirical evidence that increased adoption of innovative processing technologies
was linked to superior performance. Companies with high levels of adoption were gaining
market share. Firms with low levels of adoption were losing market share. There was no
correlation between firm size and degree of forward vertical integration. Strong support
for building products firms to allocate resources for the development and adoption of new
and innovative processing technologies is one of the strategic implications of this

The parent alkali beam and the crossed thermal beams of the K, Rb, Cs and CC14 have been
measured with respect to the parent alkali beam. The differential cross section is a
function of recoil velocity and cm angle in the center-of-mass coordinate system. The
transformation is carried out directly by selecting a single representative velocity in
each of the parent beams. The other method does not use the c.m. The coefficients
determined by a least-squares fit to the experimental data are represented by a many-term
polynomial in powers of ucose and usine. The cross sections of the two methods agree and
confirm the qualitative interpretation of previous experiments. The results obtained for
stripping the reactions of alkali atoms with halogens show a strong correlation between
the two peaks. As E' increases and K Rb Cs increases, the pattern shifts toward the
forward hemisphere. The results are correlated by a modification of the spectator model

The survival value of different parts of the Redwinged Blackbird was determined by
comparing the factors that affect it in marsh and upland breeding habitats. The hypothesis
that Redwings are being excluded from their optimal niche space is supported by the
results. colony size, breeding density, and synchrony were greater in marsh than upland
habitat. The proportion of active nests that were successful, number of young fledged per
active nest, and number fledged per egg were all measures of nest success. The lower
reproductive success of upland populations was caused by a larger proportion of nest
destruction. The marsh's predation pressure was negatively correlated with the depth of
water beneath the nest, providing an anti-predator barrier that upland populations are
unable to achieve. The swamping effect on local predator populations is a result of the
synchrony and greater density of nesting in the marsh. Growth rates, weight at fledging,
and the number fledged per successful nest were similar in the two habi- tats indicating

																																					Abstract
Redwings in marshes tend to be more active than colonies in upland habitats, but the
duration of their activity is longer in large colonies. The variation in timing is
probably related to the vegetation in the habitat and not the size of the colony. The
Redwings' survival value was reduced due to the presence of a large number of prey in the
colonies studied. In large colonies, the percentage of nests predated was lower. During
the peak of the activity, the percentage of predated nests was lower in most colonies. The
Holling model can be applied to different sized colonies. Colony size is probably limited
by a territorial system that protects adequate resources. Smaller colonies might suffer

There are some results on the estimation of parameters in differential equations. There is
no need for either the parti- cular solution of the linearized system equation or the
solution of the adjoint equa- tion for continuous observations. Consideration of the
properties of common methods such as quasi linearization at a local minimum of the
objective function, combined with the proposed scheme, is suggested for convergence to the
global minimum. An addi- tional modification of the scheme is presented. The local minimum
of the objective function is shown on a simple example. Permission was granted for this

																																					Abstract
Increasing sophistication and precision of experimental tests of relativistic gravitation
theories has led to the need for a detailed. The Parametrized Post-Newtonian formalism
treats the post-Newtonian limit of arbitrary metric theories of gravity in terms of nine
metric parameters, whose values vary from theory to theory. The de- tailed definitions and
equations for the formalism are given, as well as the theoretical and experimental founda-
tions of the PPN formalism. According to some metric theories of gravity, a massive, self-
gravitating body's passive gravitational mass should not be equal to its inertial mass,
but should be an anisotropic tensor which depends on the body's self-gravitational energy.
The PPN formalism's theoretical structure is probed by two theorems. They state that a
metric theory of gravity has post-Newtonian integral conser- vation laws if and only if
its nine PPN parameters have values which satisfy a set of seven constraint equations.

																																					Abstract
TheASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL was published in 1971 The University of Chicago. All rights
belong to the person. It was printed in the U.S.A. The first in a series of theoretical
papers will discuss the experimental foundations of general relativity. The paper reviews,
modifies, and compares two very different theoretical frameworks. The Dicke framework
doesn\'t take into account the nature of gravity or the gross features of the interaction.
The postulates of the Parametrized Post- Neacionian framework are the two tentative
conclusions. Most of the theories of gravity that are compatible with experiment are
covered by the PPN framework. Future papers in this series will develop the PPN framework
in detail, and use it to analyze a variety of relativistic effects that should be visible
in the solar system during the coming decade. Since 1963, a number of discoveries and
observations have forced Astro- physicists to make general relativity a working tool in
their theoretical model building. It would be naive to think that the very astronomical
phenomena in which rela- tivistic gravity is crucial will provide the answer. The local
behavior of matter and magnetic fields are interwoven with the effects of gravity waves.
There is no hope of getting clean tests of the nature of gravity if they are separated.
The astrophysical enterprise uses the laws of gravity as an input and tries to get out in
for- mation about what the matter and fields are doing. The greatest hopes for clean tests
of gravity lie in space and laboratory technology. The National Science Foundation and the
Office of Naval Research supported the project. Theoretical Frameworks for Testing
Relativistic Gravity is the first paper in the series. The papers in this series will tend
to be theoretical and mathematical, with the exception of the present one. ""Relativistic
Gravity in the Solar System"" will be a companion series. It will look at the nature of
various effects and their prospects for detection in the next few decades. My students and
I dedicate this series of papers to Professor S. Chandrasekhar. Professor Chandrasekhar\'s
beautiful and systematic development of post-Newtonian hydrodynamics is an indispensable
foundation for the ""PPN framework"" developed and used in this series of papers.

equivalence principle is violated in Brans-Dicke theory when the two mass differ by a
small isotropic correction. The two results are explained. The work generalizes and agrees
with previous calculations. In Paper I of this series (Thorne and Will 1971), the
theoretical and experimental foundations for metric theories of gravity were described,
and qualitative aspects of the Parametrized Post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism were discussed.
There are postulates that there exists a metric of signature -2 which governs proper
length and proper time measurements, and that the response of stressed matter to gravity
be described by the equation V.T. The covariant derivative with respect to the metric is
V, and the total stress- energy tensor is T. In this paper, a series of metric parameters
will be used to develop the PPN formalism for perfect fluids. The ""Nordtvedt effect"" is a
rela- tivistic gravity problem. The principle of equivalence is violated by theNordtvedt
effect. According to a wide class of metric theories of gravity, different massive bodies
should fall with different accelerations. This means that the body\'s mass is no longer
equal to its weight. If m is the center mass of the body, a is the acceleration of its
center mass, and U is the external (Newtonian) potential, it can be measured by means of a
test. Permission was granted for this reproduced by the copyright owner. Permission is

There is a significant range of frequencies for a representative selection of spherical
earth models. Higher Love modes can be excited to the fundamental mode for both shallow
and deep sources under a variety of circum- stances, and thus higher mode interference is
an important factor to be taken into account in the proper interpretation and analysis of
Love waves. Simple theoretical computations reveal the nature of the effect of mode
contamination on measured phase velocities, and biases in the selection and analysis of
surface wave data make it appear likely that fundamental mode Love waves experiencing
higher mode inter-ference will exhibit high apparent phase velocities. It may not be
necessary to use complex or anisotropic models to explain the observations. The effects of

The seismology study of an ocean ridge earthquake swarm in the Gulf of California in 1969
has provided new information. Similar to a foreshock-mainshock-after shock sequence, but

greater than magnitude 5 continued for over two weeks. All sources are within 10 km of
each other and hypocenters are confined to the upper crust, according to near-source
travel time data. Teleseismic P-delays for rays travelling beneath this ridge may be
interpreted in terms of an upper mantle with compressional velocities five to ten per cent
less than normal mantle to a depth of 200 km. Average apparent stresses for all swarm
events are very similar, show no consistent pattern as a function of time, and are close
to values obtained from other ridges. A large component of normal faulting is shown in the

																																					Abstract
The basic observation of this study is that seismograms written in southern California
from earthquakes within the northern Gulf of California are different from those of most.
There is a visual difference between the Baja sources and the Gulf seismograms. This is
thought to be a source effect, reflecting the relatively small source dimen- sions and low
seismic moments of the Baja earthquakes. In principle, the differences in the seismograms
could be caused by a near-source or propagation path effect, but the similarity in paths
and the large magnitude of the observed difference argue against this explanation. There
are some North Baja sources with large moments and source dimensions that show that
different seismograms are produced by different sources. Preliminary examination of
seismo- grams from events within southern California suggests the same kinds of regional
variations there. The Northern Baja earthquakes have source dimensions at least a factor
of four smaller and seismic moments, an order of magnitude less than events of similar
local magnitude within Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Permission is

It is important that this operation converts a pair of block components into a system that

system to study. The degree of microphase separation was influenced by the degree of

There is an effect of copper on the growth of Pinus densiflora. Host growth at both 0 and
15 g/g copper was improved by Suillus pictus. There was no correlation between growth
under metal stress in pure culture and whether the fungus is an early or late stage
colonizer of the host. Mycorrhizal colonization was decreased by copper, but not by
Pisolithus tinctorius and P. bicolor. There was more branching in the presence of metal if
a fungus caused the host to produce branched mycorrhizal short roots. A decrease in copper
lost from mycorrhizal roots when compared to nonmycorrhizal roots was found in all of the
fungi tested. Mycorrhizal colonization increased root and shoot levels, and the increase
was most noticeable at higher copper levels. The percent of vascular tissue in the trees
was decreased by copper. colonization with P. tinctorius caused copper to be in the shoot.
It was likely that both symbionts were responsible for the formation of the mycorrhizal
association. When two fungi were present on the same host, copper altered the ratio of
short root branching patterns. There are different ways in which heavy metal stress
affects ectomycorrhizal fungi. Colonization of tree roots by aycorrhizal partner can
improve the growth of the tree in metal contaminated soil. When grown in high metal media,

be mycorrhizal. Pinus densiflora, a non host tree, was in- oculated with cultures of B.
merulioides. Shoot weights were not increased by inoculation. Short roots lacked root
hairs and had an internal structure similar to that of anycorrhizal rootlets. The short
roots were surrounded by a loose weft of hyphae. The root weight and branching were
increased in inoculated seedlings. The culture filtrates from the liquid cultures of B.

When compared with nonmycorrhizal plants, even at high soil copper levels, there was no
increase in iron and copper. Plants grown in low P soil were so small that comparisons of
mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal plants were not possible. The correlation between
photosynthetic rate and VA mycorrhizal colonization was not found. The results show that
the presence of VA mycorrhizal fungi has no effect on plant growth when exposed to copper.
Colonization of plants by vesicular-arbuscular (VA) or endomycorrhizal fungi stimulates
growth by increasing the amount of P in soils. The colonization of the host by VA
mycorrhizal fungi may be affected by high levels of heavy metals in the soil.

																																					Abstract
A survey of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on mine spoils was conducted in
southwest Virginia and central North Carolina. Prior to sampling, mining ceased at all
sites. The soil was tested for heavy metal and pH. More than 70% of the root systems
examined were colonized by VA fungi. In 39% of the samples, there were parasites. VA
mycorrhizal fungus was collected by the majority of people. When metals were present in
the soil, the roots were colonized by VA fungi. It is possible that there is an absence of
VA mycorrhizal fungi that is limiting plant growth on abandoned mines in southwest
Virginia and central North Carolina. Colonization of herbaceous plants by vesicular-
arbuscular (VA) mycorrhizal or endomycorrhizal fungi increases the amount of phosphorus in
the soil. Many angiosperms are likely obligately VA mycorrhizal in the soil. VA
mycorrhizae can increase the amount of metalliferous micronutri- ents. The colonization of
host roots by VA mycorrhizal fungi has been shown to decrease or even be eliminated by
high levels of heavy metals in the soil. There are differences between the two types of VA
mycorrhizal spores, and zinc, copper, and manganese may be used to prevent the growth of
them. There is a survey of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on mine spoils.

																																					Abstract
The value of certain chemicals to retard the decline of crab processing waste was studied
in four experiments. Pre- vented degradation of crab processing waste can be achieved with
the addition of 1.5% propionic/formic acid. On day 28, the TMA concentration increased
from 30.76 to 30.77. It went from 40.51% to 47.02% on the dry basis. It is a reflection of
the loss of other components. The waste was ensiled with wheat straw, sugarcane molasses
and water. There was an increase in lactic acid in the silages made with or without
inoculant. With crab waste stored for 2 d, the highest pH and lowest lactic acid
concentration was observed. Residual acids may have restricted the growth of yeast. Crab
processing waste can be preserved with either.2% of NaOC1 or.4% hydro- 45.

It was possible to prevent deterioration up to d 7. When NaOC1 was used, the ratio of TMA
to N/100 g increased from 3.70 to 12.85. When H2O2 was used, the reduction in pH and high
level of lactic acid indicated that the chemicals prevented degradation, and enhanced
fermentation of the crab waste-straw mixture. The crab waste was retarded by.4% NaOC1 and
1.5% acetic acid. The highest and lowest concentration of TMA were found in the NaOH
treated waste. The highest and lowest true protein content was found in the acetic acid
treated waste. The production of NH3 was affected by the use of 1.5% NaOH. The highest
concentration of H2S was found in the waste that was treated with NaOH. The waste was
preserved for a minimum of 10 d with the use of 1% NaNO2 and 4% sodium/calcium
hypochlorite. When 1% NaNO2 was used, H2S was not detected throughout the 15 d of

In 1988 wood products firms responsible for over one third of the structural panel
production and two thirds of the softwood lumber in Canada and the United States were
surveyed to produce an inventory of new processing technologies adopted for each of these
wood products segments. Oriented strandboard and waferboard were included in the
structural panels. The proportion of 1987 production that used each technology was
measured by the Use Intensity index. For different technologies, use intensity ranged from
less than 1% to more than 90%. Multivariate statistical analysis was used to find out
which technologies were compatible with each other. Different directions for forest and
wood science research can be developed with knowledge of these changes in wood processing.
The inventory can be used to explore areas for future technological innovation in the

																																					Abstract
For a firm to remain competitive, it must allocate its limited financial resources into
areas that will maintain or improve its performance. The adoption of innovative process
technologies in the manufacture of lumber and plywood is one area that always competes for
resources. Adoption's impact on a firm's performance has never been studied. This paper
looks at the importance of adopting innovative processing technologies on a firm's
performance by grouping firms producing softwood lumber and plywood using a hierarchical
clustering technique and then profiling these firms using descriptive statistics. This
technique, using firm controllable strategic variables as clustering criteria, is rarely
used in the forest products industry. Thirty-eight firms, responsible for over 30% of 1987
North American softwood lumber production and over 70% of softwood plywood production,
provided empirical evidence that increased adoption of innovative processing technologies
was linked to superior performance. Companies with high levels of adoption were gaining
market share. Firms with low levels of adoption were losing market share. There was no
correlation between firm size and degree of forward vertical integration. Strong support
for building products firms to allocate resources for the development and adoption of new
and innovative processing technologies is one of the strategic implications of this
research. 81

The parent alkali beam and the crossed thermal beams of the K, Rb, Cs and CC14 have been
measured with respect to the parent alkali beam. The differential cross section is a
function of recoil velocity and cm angle in the center-of-mass coordinate system. The
transformation is carried out directly by selecting a single representative velocity in
each of the parent beams. The other method does not use the c.m. The coefficients
determined by a least-squares fit to the experimental data are represented by a many-term
polynomial in powers of ucose and usine. The cross sections of the two methods agree and
confirm the qualitative interpretation of previous experiments. The results obtained for
stripping the reactions of alkali atoms with halogens show a strong correlation between
the two peaks. As E' increases and K Rb Cs increases, the pattern shifts toward the
forward hemisphere. The results are correlated by a modification of the spectator model
and a phenomenological analysis similar to that used for the rainbow effect in elastic

important. Microbial populations on plant detrital particles which are larger than those
normally accommodated by suspension feeders are present in most shallow water
environments. The Lucinacea can accept and process large detrital particles. Most other
suspension feeding bivalves have food supplies that are not available to them. The species
co-occur frequently but are not correlated with their distributions. The eurytopic species

The survival value of different parts of the Redwinged Blackbird was determined by
comparing the factors that affect it in marsh and upland breeding habitats. The hypothesis
that Redwings are being excluded from their optimal niche space is supported by the
results. colony size, breeding density, and synchrony were greater in marsh than upland
habitat. The proportion of active nests that were successful, number of young fledged per
active nest, and number fledged per egg were all measures of nest success. The lower
reproductive success of upland populations was caused by a larger proportion of nest
destruction. The marsh's predation pressure was negatively correlated with the depth of
water beneath the nest, providing an anti-predator barrier that upland populations are
unable to achieve. The swamping effect on local predator populations is a result of the
synchrony and greater density of nesting in the marsh. Growth rates, weight at fledging,
and the number fledged per successful nest were similar in the two habi- tats indicating

																																					Abstract
Redwings in marshes tend to be more active than colonies in upland habitats, but the
duration of their activity is longer in large colonies. The variation in timing is
probably related to the vegetation in the habitat and not the size of the colony. The
Redwings' survival value was reduced due to the presence of a large number of prey in the
colonies studied. In large colonies, the percentage of nests predated was lower. During
the peak of the activity, the percentage of predated nests was lower in most colonies. The
Holling model can be applied to different sized colonies. Colony size is probably limited
by a territorial system that protects adequate resources. Smaller colonies might suffer
less predation, but genetic exchange can be produced with the permission of the copyright

The mean weight at fledging is the same for Redwing nestlings in marsh and upland

percentage of nestlings that die from starvation is the same. The mean number is similar
between habitats. It is suggested that the relative abundance of food is the same for
nestlings in either marshes or uplands, but that a higher absolute abundance of food in
marshes makes large, dense colonies possible. There are obvious differences in the

Increasing sophistication and precision of experimental tests of relativistic gravitation
theories has led to the need for a detailed. The Parametrized Post-Newtonian formalism
treats the post-Newtonian limit of arbitrary metric theories of gravity in terms of nine
metric parameters, whose values vary from theory to theory. The de- tailed definitions and
equations for the formalism are given, as well as the theoretical and experimental founda-
tions of the PPN formalism. According to some metric theories of gravity, a massive, self-
gravitating body's passive gravitational mass should not be equal to its inertial mass,
but should be an anisotropic tensor which depends on the body's self-gravitational energy.
The PPN formalism's theoretical structure is probed by two theorems. They state that a
metric theory of gravity has post-Newtonian integral conser- vation laws if and only if
its nine PPN parameters have values which satisfy a set of seven constraint equations.

TheASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL was published in 1971 The University of Chicago. All rights
belong to the person. It was printed in the U.S.A. The first in a series of theoretical
papers will discuss the experimental foundations of general relativity. The paper reviews,
modifies, and compares two very different theoretical frameworks. The Dicke framework
doesn\'t take into account the nature of gravity or the gross features of the interaction.
The postulates of the Parametrized Post- Neacionian framework are the two tentative
conclusions. Most of the theories of gravity that are compatible with experiment are
covered by the PPN framework. Future papers in this series will develop the PPN framework
in detail, and use it to analyze a variety of relativistic effects that should be visible
in the solar system during the coming decade. Since 1963, a number of discoveries and
observations have forced Astro- physicists to make general relativity a working tool in
their theoretical model building. It would be naive to think that the very astronomical
phenomena in which rela- tivistic gravity is crucial will provide the answer. The local
behavior of matter and magnetic fields are interwoven with the effects of gravity waves.
There is no hope of getting clean tests of the nature of gravity if they are separated.
The astrophysical enterprise uses the laws of gravity as an input and tries to get out in
for- mation about what the matter and fields are doing. The greatest hopes for clean tests
of gravity lie in space and laboratory technology. The National Science Foundation and the
Office of Naval Research supported the project. Theoretical Frameworks for Testing
Relativistic Gravity is the first paper in the series. The papers in this series will tend
to be theoretical and mathematical, with the exception of the present one. ""Relativistic
Gravity in the Solar System"" will be a companion series. It will look at the nature of
various effects and their prospects for detection in the next few decades. My students and
I dedicate this series of papers to Professor S. Chandrasekhar. Professor Chandrasekhar\'s
beautiful and systematic development of post-Newtonian hydrodynamics is an indispensable
foundation for the ""PPN framework"" developed and used in this series of papers.

equivalence principle is violated in Brans-Dicke theory when the two mass differ by a
small isotropic correction. The two results are explained. The work generalizes and agrees
with previous calculations. In Paper I of this series (Thorne and Will 1971), the
theoretical and experimental foundations for metric theories of gravity were described,
and qualitative aspects of the Parametrized Post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism were discussed.
There are postulates that there exists a metric of signature -2 which governs proper
length and proper time measurements, and that the response of stressed matter to gravity
be described by the equation V.T. The covariant derivative with respect to the metric is
V, and the total stress- energy tensor is T. In this paper, a series of metric parameters
will be used to develop the PPN formalism for perfect fluids. The ""Nordtvedt effect"" is a
rela- tivistic gravity problem. The principle of equivalence is violated by theNordtvedt
effect. According to a wide class of metric theories of gravity, different massive bodies
should fall with different accelerations. This means that the body\'s mass is no longer
equal to its weight. If m is the center mass of the body, a is the acceleration of its
center mass, and U is the external (Newtonian) potential, it can be measured by means of a
test. Permission was granted for this reproduced by the copyright owner. Permission is

There is a significant range of frequencies for a representative selection of spherical
earth models. Higher Love modes can be excited to the fundamental mode for both shallow
and deep sources under a variety of circum- stances, and thus higher mode interference is
an important factor to be taken into account in the proper interpretation and analysis of
Love waves. Simple theoretical computations reveal the nature of the effect of mode
contamination on measured phase velocities, and biases in the selection and analysis of
surface wave data make it appear likely that fundamental mode Love waves experiencing
higher mode inter-ference will exhibit high apparent phase velocities. It may not be

																																					Abstract
The basic observation of this study is that seismograms written in southern California
from earthquakes within the northern Gulf of California are different from those of most.
There is a visual difference between the Baja sources and the Gulf seismograms. This is
thought to be a source effect, reflecting the relatively small source dimen- sions and low
seismic moments of the Baja earthquakes. In principle, the differences in the seismograms
could be caused by a near-source or propagation path effect, but the similarity in paths
and the large magnitude of the observed difference argue against this explanation. There
are some North Baja sources with large moments and source dimensions that show that
different seismograms are produced by different sources. Preliminary examination of
seismo- grams from events within southern California suggests the same kinds of regional
variations there. The Northern Baja earthquakes have source dimensions at least a factor
of four smaller and seismic moments, an order of magnitude less than events of similar

activated and repressed by the addition of the polyamines putrescine and spermidine. The

																																					Abstract
The Department of Biology Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Blacksburg
is located in Virginia. The most tolerant of copper were Pisolithus tinctorius and
Boletinellus merulioides. Piloderma bicolor was very tolerant. The copper ion was
deposited outside the cell wall in S. pictus and inside the cell wall in P. tintorius. The
results suggest that there may be differences in growth rates observed on copper amended
media. It is likely incorrect to postulate a single mechanism for metal tolerance and
subsequent improvement of host plant growth in such a diverse group of organisms. Key
words are copper, ultrastructure, tolerance, polysaccharides, cell walls and
ectomycorrhizae. The growth of other organisms is severely restricted by the ability of
some fungi to grow at high levels of copper. A number of mechanisms of copper tolerance
can be found in the fungi. The production and deposition of copper oxalate in the
extracellular hyphal sheath of some wood-rotting fungi is one example. There is a
deposition of hydrogen sulfide in the cell wall of S. cereviseae.

There is an effect of copper on the growth of Pinus densiflora. Host growth at both 0 and
15 g/g copper was improved by Suillus pictus. There was no correlation between growth
under metal stress in pure culture and whether the fungus is an early or late stage
colonizer of the host. Mycorrhizal colonization was decreased by copper, but not by
Pisolithus tinctorius and P. bicolor. There was more branching in the presence of metal if
a fungus caused the host to produce branched mycorrhizal short roots. A decrease in copper
lost from mycorrhizal roots when compared to nonmycorrhizal roots was found in all of the
fungi tested. Mycorrhizal colonization increased root and shoot levels, and the increase
was most noticeable at higher copper levels. The percent of vascular tissue in the trees
was decreased by copper. colonization with P. tinctorius caused copper to be in the shoot.
It was likely that both symbionts were responsible for the formation of the mycorrhizal
association. When two fungi were present on the same host, copper altered the ratio of
short root branching patterns. There are different ways in which heavy metal stress
affects ectomycorrhizal fungi. Colonization of tree roots by aycorrhizal partner can
improve the growth of the tree in metal contaminated soil. When grown in high metal media,
Mycorrhizal Betula can incorporate less zinc and nickel into the aboveground parts of the

																																					Abstract
The Department of Biology is at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University
Blacksburg. Although it is associated with Fraxinus americana, it has never been proven to
be mycorrhizal. Pinus densiflora, a non host tree, was in- oculated with cultures of B.
merulioides. Shoot weights were not increased by inoculation. Short roots lacked root
hairs and had an internal structure similar to that of anycorrhizal rootlets. The short
roots were surrounded by a loose weft of hyphae. The root weight and branching were
increased in inoculated seedlings. The culture filtrates from the liquid cultures of B.
merulioides and Pisolithus tinctorius were analyzed. Both fungi produced measureable
quantities of indole-3-acetic acid. The results show that IAA is the compound responsible
for the dichotomization in the short roots of P. densiflora. Key words: Boletinellus
merulioides, Pisolithus tinctorius, IAA, HPLC, and ectomycorrhizae are commonly associated
in nature with members of the Fagus. Boletinellus merulioides is found in the southeastern
United States. Murrill is collected near Fagus americana L. B. meruliodes is a member of
the Boletaceae, a family that some authors consider to be exclusively mycorrhizal. The
ability to form a mycorrhizal association has not yet been demonstrated in pure culture

examined were colonized by VA fungi. In 39% of the samples, there were parasites. VA
mycorrhizal fungus was collected by the majority of people. When metals were present in

For a firm to remain competitive, it must allocate its limited financial resources into
areas that will maintain or improve its performance. The adoption of innovative process
technologies in the manufacture of lumber and plywood is one area that always competes for
resources. Adoption's impact on a firm's performance has never been studied. This paper
looks at the importance of adopting innovative processing technologies on a firm's
performance by grouping firms producing softwood lumber and plywood using a hierarchical
clustering technique and then profiling these firms using descriptive statistics. This
technique, using firm controllable strategic variables as clustering criteria, is rarely
used in the forest products industry. Thirty-eight firms, responsible for over 30% of 1987
North American softwood lumber production and over 70% of softwood plywood production,
provided empirical evidence that increased adoption of innovative processing technologies
was linked to superior performance. Companies with high levels of adoption were gaining
market share. Firms with low levels of adoption were losing market share. There was no
correlation between firm size and degree of forward vertical integration. Strong support
for building products firms to allocate resources for the development and adoption of new
and innovative processing technologies is one of the strategic implications of this

																																					Abstract
The Department of Radiology and Radiation Biology at Colorado State University is located
in Fort Collins, Colorado. A run-off experiment was conducted with a mountain Podzol soil.
PoO2 was applied to the litter layer as a point source from water collection vessels at
the base of a 30 percent slope. The soil's core is what means annual rainfall. There was 6
inches of ice that was melted. The run-off water was collected at the base of the slope at
the bottom of the litter layer. Data from soil cores were used to predict the movement of
PoO2 to a stream. The first 50 cm of the stream is the most polluted part of the water.

An international corporation has several product-market strategies. Minor modifications of
existing products can be moved into new foreign markets. Difficulties of such a move are
to determine which variant should be used in a market and associated optimum transfer or
sales prices. Fixed costs of producing new product variations, shipping, inventory, and
tariffs are included in the costs. Legal, cultural and environmental considerations need
to be looked at. The model presented in the paper can be used to develop an optimum
marketing strategy. A solution procedure can be used to solve large problems and can be

The modular design problem was set up by David Evans. There are several components that
make up the module in this problem. All component re- quirements will need to be satisfied
with j, yj modules. It's difficult to design a module that the requirements are satisfied
at a minimum cost of surplus components. The problem is Minimize x,y i for all i,j Subject
Xisy are positive integers and 'i' dj are constants. There are two parts to the paper. The
difficulties of rounding the continuous solution are described in the first part of the
problem. There are some properties of the constraint set that aid in the solution of the
problem. The two procedures outlined by Evans and Charnes and Kirby for the non-integer
case can't be used to find the integer solution. An integer branch and bound technique has
been shown to be useful in the solution of small problems and has the potential to be used
in larger problems. The objective func tion is discussed in the second part of the paper.

The survival value of different parts of the Redwinged Blackbird was determined by
comparing the factors that affect it in marsh and upland breeding habitats. The hypothesis
that Redwings are being excluded from their optimal niche space is supported by the
results. colony size, breeding density, and synchrony were greater in marsh than upland
habitat. The proportion of active nests that were successful, number of young fledged per
active nest, and number fledged per egg were all measures of nest success. The lower
reproductive success of upland populations was caused by a larger proportion of nest
destruction. The marsh's predation pressure was negatively correlated with the depth of
water beneath the nest, providing an anti-predator barrier that upland populations are
unable to achieve. The swamping effect on local predator populations is a result of the
synchrony and greater density of nesting in the marsh. Growth rates, weight at fledging,
and the number fledged per successful nest were similar in the two habi- tats indicating

																																					Abstract
Redwings in marshes tend to be more active than colonies in upland habitats, but the
duration of their activity is longer in large colonies. The variation in timing is
probably related to the vegetation in the habitat and not the size of the colony. The
Redwings' survival value was reduced due to the presence of a large number of prey in the
colonies studied. In large colonies, the percentage of nests predated was lower. During
the peak of the activity, the percentage of predated nests was lower in most colonies. The
Holling model can be applied to different sized colonies. Colony size is probably limited
by a territorial system that protects adequate resources. Smaller colonies might suffer
less predation, but genetic exchange can be produced with the permission of the copyright

Increasing sophistication and precision of experimental tests of relativistic gravitation
theories has led to the need for a detailed. The Parametrized Post-Newtonian formalism
treats the post-Newtonian limit of arbitrary metric theories of gravity in terms of nine
metric parameters, whose values vary from theory to theory. The de- tailed definitions and
equations for the formalism are given, as well as the theoretical and experimental founda-
tions of the PPN formalism. According to some metric theories of gravity, a massive, self-
gravitating body's passive gravitational mass should not be equal to its inertial mass,
but should be an anisotropic tensor which depends on the body's self-gravitational energy.
The PPN formalism's theoretical structure is probed by two theorems. They state that a
metric theory of gravity has post-Newtonian integral conser- vation laws if and only if
its nine PPN parameters have values which satisfy a set of seven constraint equations.

TheASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL was published in 1971 The University of Chicago. All rights
belong to the person. It was printed in the U.S.A. The first in a series of theoretical
papers will discuss the experimental foundations of general relativity. The paper reviews,
modifies, and compares two very different theoretical frameworks. The Dicke framework
doesn\'t take into account the nature of gravity or the gross features of the interaction.
The postulates of the Parametrized Post- Neacionian framework are the two tentative
conclusions. Most of the theories of gravity that are compatible with experiment are
covered by the PPN framework. Future papers in this series will develop the PPN framework
in detail, and use it to analyze a variety of relativistic effects that should be visible
in the solar system during the coming decade. Since 1963, a number of discoveries and
observations have forced Astro- physicists to make general relativity a working tool in
their theoretical model building. It would be naive to think that the very astronomical
phenomena in which rela- tivistic gravity is crucial will provide the answer. The local
behavior of matter and magnetic fields are interwoven with the effects of gravity waves.
There is no hope of getting clean tests of the nature of gravity if they are separated.
The astrophysical enterprise uses the laws of gravity as an input and tries to get out in
for- mation about what the matter and fields are doing. The greatest hopes for clean tests
of gravity lie in space and laboratory technology. The National Science Foundation and the
Office of Naval Research supported the project. Theoretical Frameworks for Testing
Relativistic Gravity is the first paper in the series. The papers in this series will tend
to be theoretical and mathematical, with the exception of the present one. ""Relativistic
Gravity in the Solar System"" will be a companion series. It will look at the nature of
various effects and their prospects for detection in the next few decades. My students and
I dedicate this series of papers to Professor S. Chandrasekhar. Professor Chandrasekhar\'s
beautiful and systematic development of post-Newtonian hydrodynamics is an indispensable
foundation for the ""PPN framework"" developed and used in this series of papers.

equivalence principle is violated in Brans-Dicke theory when the two mass differ by a
small isotropic correction. The two results are explained. The work generalizes and agrees
with previous calculations. In Paper I of this series (Thorne and Will 1971), the
theoretical and experimental foundations for metric theories of gravity were described,
and qualitative aspects of the Parametrized Post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism were discussed.
There are postulates that there exists a metric of signature -2 which governs proper
length and proper time measurements, and that the response of stressed matter to gravity
be described by the equation V.T. The covariant derivative with respect to the metric is
V, and the total stress- energy tensor is T. In this paper, a series of metric parameters
will be used to develop the PPN formalism for perfect fluids. The ""Nordtvedt effect"" is a
rela- tivistic gravity problem. The principle of equivalence is violated by theNordtvedt
effect. According to a wide class of metric theories of gravity, different massive bodies
should fall with different accelerations. This means that the body\'s mass is no longer
equal to its weight. If m is the center mass of the body, a is the acceleration of its
center mass, and U is the external (Newtonian) potential, it can be measured by means of a
test. Permission was granted for this reproduced by the copyright owner. Permission is

There is a significant range of frequencies for a representative selection of spherical
earth models. Higher Love modes can be excited to the fundamental mode for both shallow
and deep sources under a variety of circum- stances, and thus higher mode interference is
an important factor to be taken into account in the proper interpretation and analysis of
Love waves. Simple theoretical computations reveal the nature of the effect of mode
contamination on measured phase velocities, and biases in the selection and analysis of
surface wave data make it appear likely that fundamental mode Love waves experiencing
higher mode inter-ference will exhibit high apparent phase velocities. It may not be

The basic observation of this study is that seismograms written in southern California
from earthquakes within the northern Gulf of California are different from those of most.
There is a visual difference between the Baja sources and the Gulf seismograms. This is
thought to be a source effect, reflecting the relatively small source dimen- sions and low
seismic moments of the Baja earthquakes. In principle, the differences in the seismograms
could be caused by a near-source or propagation path effect, but the similarity in paths
and the large magnitude of the observed difference argue against this explanation. There
are some North Baja sources with large moments and source dimensions that show that
different seismograms are produced by different sources. Preliminary examination of
seismo- grams from events within southern California suggests the same kinds of regional
variations there. The Northern Baja earthquakes have source dimensions at least a factor
of four smaller and seismic moments, an order of magnitude less than events of similar

A combination of basic polyhedral units can be used to model the physical properties of
silicate minerals. They could be modeled as the sum of polyhedral contributions. The
contribution of H2O-FeO(6)-Fe(OH) has been determined by multiple regression. We can use
the data to estimate the AG and AH, of other silicate minerals from a weighted sum of the
contribution of each oxide and hydroxide component. The method outlined here can be used
to estimate the thermodynamic properties of silicate phases which are too complex or
impure to give reliable calorimetric measurements. The minerals used in the model have
associated average residuals of 0.26% and 0.24%. The average difference between the
measured and predicted values of 0.25 for AG for 18 minerals and 0.22 for 20 minerals is
less than the difference between the measured and predicted values of 0.25 for AG for 20
minerals. 47 is a number.

The technique that we developed to estimate AGP of silicate minerals by summing the
contribution of polyhedral components can be extended to predict the free energy of
formation of silicate minerals at higher temperatures. Multiple linear regression was used
to find the contribution of the Al2O3(4) - Al2O3(6) The gi coefficients from this model
can be used to calculate the enthalpy of one mole of each oxide or hydroxide component at
a higher temperature. Two seperate linear regressions were used to determine gwater. For
21 minerals used in the model, there are differences of 0.20%, 0.20%, and 0.22% at 400,
500, and 600 K. Experimentally measured AGF versus predicted AGF for four, three, and two

The effect of copper on the activity of the tyrannosaurus rex is studied. Two of the
fungi, Pisolithus tinctorius and Boletinellus merulioides, have naturally brown pigmented
hyphae. The hyphae were developed in the presence of copper. The extracellular tyrosinase
produced by S. pictus was 60 g/g copper. The yellow and black hyphae of Piloderma bicolor
and Cenococcum graniforme were unaffected by copper. The activity of P. tinctorius and S.
granulatus decreased when they were grown under copper stress. The reaction mixture was
activated and repressed by the addition of the polyamines putrescine and spermidine. The
Polyamine content of P. tinctorius and B. merulioides was not altered by the addition of
copper. A decrease in the polyamine content may indicate a change in the permeability of
the cells. Key words are copper and polyamines. Copper can be toxic at relatively low
concentrations, but is essential for normal growth and development. The availability of
copper increases when the pH of the growth medium decreases. The mechanisms of tolerate

																																					Abstract
The Department of Biology Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Blacksburg
is located in Virginia. The most tolerant of copper were Pisolithus tinctorius and
Boletinellus merulioides. Piloderma bicolor was very tolerant. The copper ion was
deposited outside the cell wall in S. pictus and inside the cell wall in P. tintorius. The
results suggest that there may be differences in growth rates observed on copper amended
media. It is likely incorrect to postulate a single mechanism for metal tolerance and
subsequent improvement of host plant growth in such a diverse group of organisms. Key
words are copper, ultrastructure, tolerance, polysaccharides, cell walls and
ectomycorrhizae. The growth of other organisms is severely restricted by the ability of
some fungi to grow at high levels of copper. A number of mechanisms of copper tolerance
can be found in the fungi. The production and deposition of copper oxalate in the
extracellular hyphal sheath of some wood-rotting fungi is one example. There is a
deposition of hydrogen sulfide in the cell wall of S. cereviseae.

																																					Abstract
There is an effect of copper on the growth of Pinus densiflora. Host growth at both 0 and
15 g/g copper was improved by Suillus pictus. There was no correlation between growth
under metal stress in pure culture and whether the fungus is an early or late stage
colonizer of the host. Mycorrhizal colonization was decreased by copper, but not by
Pisolithus tinctorius and P. bicolor. There was more branching in the presence of metal if
a fungus caused the host to produce branched mycorrhizal short roots. A decrease in copper
lost from mycorrhizal roots when compared to nonmycorrhizal roots was found in all of the
fungi tested. Mycorrhizal colonization increased root and shoot levels, and the increase
was most noticeable at higher copper levels. The percent of vascular tissue in the trees
was decreased by copper. colonization with P. tinctorius caused copper to be in the shoot.
It was likely that both symbionts were responsible for the formation of the mycorrhizal
association. When two fungi were present on the same host, copper altered the ratio of
short root branching patterns. There are different ways in which heavy metal stress
affects ectomycorrhizal fungi. Colonization of tree roots by aycorrhizal partner can
improve the growth of the tree in metal contaminated soil. When grown in high metal media,
Mycorrhizal Betula can incorporate less zinc and nickel into the aboveground parts of the

																																					Abstract
The Department of Biology is at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University
Blacksburg. Although it is associated with Fraxinus americana, it has never been proven to
be mycorrhizal. Pinus densiflora, a non host tree, was in- oculated with cultures of B.
merulioides. Shoot weights were not increased by inoculation. Short roots lacked root
hairs and had an internal structure similar to that of anycorrhizal rootlets. The short
roots were surrounded by a loose weft of hyphae. The root weight and branching were
increased in inoculated seedlings. The culture filtrates from the liquid cultures of B.
merulioides and Pisolithus tinctorius were analyzed. Both fungi produced measureable
quantities of indole-3-acetic acid. The results show that IAA is the compound responsible
for the dichotomization in the short roots of P. densiflora. Key words: Boletinellus
merulioides, Pisolithus tinctorius, IAA, HPLC, and ectomycorrhizae are commonly associated
in nature with members of the Fagus. Boletinellus merulioides is found in the southeastern

technologies in the manufacture of lumber and plywood is one area that always competes for

looks at the importance of adopting innovative processing technologies on a firm's
performance by grouping firms producing softwood lumber and plywood using a hierarchical
clustering technique and then profiling these firms using descriptive statistics. This
technique, using firm controllable strategic variables as clustering criteria, is rarely
used in the forest products industry. Thirty-eight firms, responsible for over 30% of 1987
North American softwood lumber production and over 70% of softwood plywood production,
provided empirical evidence that increased adoption of innovative processing technologies
was linked to superior performance. Companies with high levels of adoption were gaining
market share. Firms with low levels of adoption were losing market share. There was no

for building products firms to allocate resources for the development and adoption of new

function of recoil velocity and cm angle in the center-of-mass coordinate system. The
transformation is carried out directly by selecting a single representative velocity in

determined by a least-squares fit to the experimental data are represented by a many-term

confirm the qualitative interpretation of previous experiments. The results obtained for
stripping the reactions of alkali atoms with halogens show a strong correlation between

A simple coordinate transformation is presented to convert LAB velocity-space coordinates
to their c.m. counterparts. The trans- formation of intensities between the two frames is
reviewed, and these two results are applied to the kinematic problem, obtaining the c.m.
reactive scattering cross section as a function of scattering angle and speed of recoil
from observed data. For an experiment with initial conditions and velo- city analysis of
the product, the simple application of kinematic relations suffices to determine the c.m.
function. The problem becomes more complicated if there is a spread. The simplest way to
proceed in this case is to ignore the spread. A more rigorous method uses the least
squares fitting technique to give a c.m. cross section which reproduces the data after
velocity-averaging. The least squares method is applied to this problem again after a
review of previous analytical schemes. The effects of velocity-averaging on desirability
of various experimental arrangements are discussed. A recently developed method is

The distributions of H and D atoms produced in cross-beam reactions have been measured.
The reaction exoergicity varies from AD 2 17 kcal/mole for H + KF to -4 kcal/mole for H +

correlate with AD or the identity of the halogen. Qr is larger for the Cs reaction than it
is for K and D is larger than it is for H. The shape of the dis-tribution is similar for K

The survival value of different parts of the Redwinged Blackbird was determined by
comparing the factors that affect it in marsh and upland breeding habitats. The hypothesis
that Redwings are being excluded from their optimal niche space is supported by the
results. colony size, breeding density, and synchrony were greater in marsh than upland
habitat. The proportion of active nests that were successful, number of young fledged per
active nest, and number fledged per egg were all measures of nest success. The lower
reproductive success of upland populations was caused by a larger proportion of nest
destruction. The marsh's predation pressure was negatively correlated with the depth of
water beneath the nest, providing an anti-predator barrier that upland populations are
unable to achieve. The swamping effect on local predator populations is a result of the
synchrony and greater density of nesting in the marsh. Growth rates, weight at fledging,

Redwings in marshes tend to be more active than colonies in upland habitats, but the
duration of their activity is longer in large colonies. The variation in timing is
probably related to the vegetation in the habitat and not the size of the colony. The
Redwings' survival value was reduced due to the presence of a large number of prey in the
colonies studied. In large colonies, the percentage of nests predated was lower. During
the peak of the activity, the percentage of predated nests was lower in most colonies. The
Holling model can be applied to different sized colonies. Colony size is probably limited

Increasing sophistication and precision of experimental tests of relativistic gravitation
theories has led to the need for a detailed. The Parametrized Post-Newtonian formalism
treats the post-Newtonian limit of arbitrary metric theories of gravity in terms of nine
metric parameters, whose values vary from theory to theory. The de- tailed definitions and
equations for the formalism are given, as well as the theoretical and experimental founda-
tions of the PPN formalism. According to some metric theories of gravity, a massive, self-
gravitating body's passive gravitational mass should not be equal to its inertial mass,
but should be an anisotropic tensor which depends on the body's self-gravitational energy.
The PPN formalism's theoretical structure is probed by two theorems. They state that a
metric theory of gravity has post-Newtonian integral conser- vation laws if and only if
its nine PPN parameters have values which satisfy a set of seven constraint equations.

papers will discuss the experimental foundations of general relativity. The paper reviews,
modifies, and compares two very different theoretical frameworks. The Dicke framework
doesn\'t take into account the nature of gravity or the gross features of the interaction.
The postulates of the Parametrized Post- Neacionian framework are the two tentative
conclusions. Most of the theories of gravity that are compatible with experiment are
covered by the PPN framework. Future papers in this series will develop the PPN framework
in detail, and use it to analyze a variety of relativistic effects that should be visible
in the solar system during the coming decade. Since 1963, a number of discoveries and
observations have forced Astro- physicists to make general relativity a working tool in
their theoretical model building. It would be naive to think that the very astronomical
phenomena in which rela- tivistic gravity is crucial will provide the answer. The local
behavior of matter and magnetic fields are interwoven with the effects of gravity waves.
There is no hope of getting clean tests of the nature of gravity if they are separated.
The astrophysical enterprise uses the laws of gravity as an input and tries to get out in
for- mation about what the matter and fields are doing. The greatest hopes for clean tests
of gravity lie in space and laboratory technology. The National Science Foundation and the

various effects and their prospects for detection in the next few decades. My students and

equivalence principle is violated in Brans-Dicke theory when the two mass differ by a

with previous calculations. In Paper I of this series (Thorne and Will 1971), the
theoretical and experimental foundations for metric theories of gravity were described,
and qualitative aspects of the Parametrized Post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism were discussed.
There are postulates that there exists a metric of signature -2 which governs proper
length and proper time measurements, and that the response of stressed matter to gravity
be described by the equation V.T. The covariant derivative with respect to the metric is
V, and the total stress- energy tensor is T. In this paper, a series of metric parameters
will be used to develop the PPN formalism for perfect fluids. The ""Nordtvedt effect"" is a
rela- tivistic gravity problem. The principle of equivalence is violated by theNordtvedt
effect. According to a wide class of metric theories of gravity, different massive bodies
should fall with different accelerations. This means that the body\'s mass is no longer
equal to its weight. If m is the center mass of the body, a is the acceleration of its
center mass, and U is the external (Newtonian) potential, it can be measured by means of a
test. Permission was granted for this reproduced by the copyright owner. Permission is

The basic observation of this study is that seismograms written in southern California
from earthquakes within the northern Gulf of California are different from those of most.
There is a visual difference between the Baja sources and the Gulf seismograms. This is
thought to be a source effect, reflecting the relatively small source dimen- sions and low
seismic moments of the Baja earthquakes. In principle, the differences in the seismograms
could be caused by a near-source or propagation path effect, but the similarity in paths
and the large magnitude of the observed difference argue against this explanation. There
are some North Baja sources with large moments and source dimensions that show that
different seismograms are produced by different sources. Preliminary examination of
seismo- grams from events within southern California suggests the same kinds of regional
variations there. The Northern Baja earthquakes have source dimensions at least a factor
of four smaller and seismic moments, an order of magnitude less than events of similar

is likely to have a high degree of microphase separation. The series is an excellent model
system to study. The degree of microphase separation was influenced by the degree of
hydrogenation. Consideration was given to the physical properties of the diene originating
segment, having extreme compositions of polyisoprene and an ethylene propylene alternating
as well as a number of partially unsaturated versions. The investigation shows that it was
possible to control tack and holding power.

																																					Abstract
In the southeastern USA, forage availability in the summer is an important limitation to
the size of herds. Tall-growing, perennial, warm-season grasses that produce 65 to 75% of
their yield in mid-summer may provide needed summer grazing; however, their establishment
is often slow and inconsistent when compared to cool-season species. To make these species
less vulnerable to weed competition, methods are needed. The two tall-growing, perennial,
warm-season grasses were planted in Blacksburg, VA located at 37 11' N 80 25' W at 610 m
elevation on a Grose close soil (clayey, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludult). The establishment

effect of atrazine was moderated by the addition of carbofuran. Direct statistical

																																					Abstract
Cool-season perennial grass productivity plummets during hot, dry weather. In the United
States and especially in the Southeast, there has been a summer slump. Perennial, tall-
growing, warm- season forage grasses produce abundant herbage during the summer and could
make a contribution to southeastern systems. The relatively long period required to
produce grazable stands of warm-season grasses is problematic. Problems with establishment
need to be investigated before these warm-season species can be incorporated into a summer
system. Research was done to evaluate the influence of limestone, P, and carbofuran on the
establishment of switchgrass. The killed sod in Blacksburg, VA is located at 610 m
elevation and was planted in 1985 and 1986. The soil was a mixture of clayey and mesic
Typic Fragiuduit. The treatments included placing the seed in the row with the limestone
at o and 4.48 Mg/ha.

A combination of basic polyhedral units can be used to model the physical properties of
silicate minerals. They could be modeled as the sum of polyhedral contributions. The
contribution of H2O-FeO(6)-Fe(OH) has been determined by multiple regression. We can use
the data to estimate the AG and AH, of other silicate minerals from a weighted sum of the
contribution of each oxide and hydroxide component. The method outlined here can be used
to estimate the thermodynamic properties of silicate phases which are too complex or
impure to give reliable calorimetric measurements. The minerals used in the model have
associated average residuals of 0.26% and 0.24%. The average difference between the
measured and predicted values of 0.25 for AG for 18 minerals and 0.22 for 20 minerals is
less than the difference between the measured and predicted values of 0.25 for AG for 20

The technique that we developed to estimate AGP of silicate minerals by summing the
contribution of polyhedral components can be extended to predict the free energy of
formation of silicate minerals at higher temperatures. Multiple linear regression was used
to find the contribution of the Al2O3(4) - Al2O3(6) The gi coefficients from this model
can be used to calculate the enthalpy of one mole of each oxide or hydroxide component at
a higher temperature. Two seperate linear regressions were used to determine gwater. For
21 minerals used in the model, there are differences of 0.20%, 0.20%, and 0.22% at 400,

The effect of copper on the activity of the tyrannosaurus rex is studied. Two of the
fungi, Pisolithus tinctorius and Boletinellus merulioides, have naturally brown pigmented
hyphae. The hyphae were developed in the presence of copper. The extracellular tyrosinase
produced by S. pictus was 60 g/g copper. The yellow and black hyphae of Piloderma bicolor
and Cenococcum graniforme were unaffected by copper. The activity of P. tinctorius and S.
granulatus decreased when they were grown under copper stress. The reaction mixture was
activated and repressed by the addition of the polyamines putrescine and spermidine. The
Polyamine content of P. tinctorius and B. merulioides was not altered by the addition of
copper. A decrease in the polyamine content may indicate a change in the permeability of
the cells. Key words are copper and polyamines. Copper can be toxic at relatively low
concentrations, but is essential for normal growth and development. The availability of
copper increases when the pH of the growth medium decreases. The mechanisms of tolerate

																																					Abstract
The Department of Biology Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Blacksburg
is located in Virginia. The most tolerant of copper were Pisolithus tinctorius and
Boletinellus merulioides. Piloderma bicolor was very tolerant. The copper ion was
deposited outside the cell wall in S. pictus and inside the cell wall in P. tintorius. The
results suggest that there may be differences in growth rates observed on copper amended
media. It is likely incorrect to postulate a single mechanism for metal tolerance and
subsequent improvement of host plant growth in such a diverse group of organisms. Key
words are copper, ultrastructure, tolerance, polysaccharides, cell walls and
ectomycorrhizae. The growth of other organisms is severely restricted by the ability of
some fungi to grow at high levels of copper. A number of mechanisms of copper tolerance
can be found in the fungi. The production and deposition of copper oxalate in the
extracellular hyphal sheath of some wood-rotting fungi is one example. There is a

																																					Abstract
There is an effect of copper on the growth of Pinus densiflora. Host growth at both 0 and
15 g/g copper was improved by Suillus pictus. There was no correlation between growth
under metal stress in pure culture and whether the fungus is an early or late stage
colonizer of the host. Mycorrhizal colonization was decreased by copper, but not by
Pisolithus tinctorius and P. bicolor. There was more branching in the presence of metal if
a fungus caused the host to produce branched mycorrhizal short roots. A decrease in copper
lost from mycorrhizal roots when compared to nonmycorrhizal roots was found in all of the
fungi tested. Mycorrhizal colonization increased root and shoot levels, and the increase
was most noticeable at higher copper levels. The percent of vascular tissue in the trees
was decreased by copper. colonization with P. tinctorius caused copper to be in the shoot.
It was likely that both symbionts were responsible for the formation of the mycorrhizal
association. When two fungi were present on the same host, copper altered the ratio of
short root branching patterns. There are different ways in which heavy metal stress
affects ectomycorrhizal fungi. Colonization of tree roots by aycorrhizal partner can
improve the growth of the tree in metal contaminated soil. When grown in high metal media,
Mycorrhizal Betula can incorporate less zinc and nickel into the aboveground parts of the

The Department of Biology is at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University
Blacksburg. Although it is associated with Fraxinus americana, it has never been proven to
be mycorrhizal. Pinus densiflora, a non host tree, was in- oculated with cultures of B.
merulioides. Shoot weights were not increased by inoculation. Short roots lacked root
hairs and had an internal structure similar to that of anycorrhizal rootlets. The short
roots were surrounded by a loose weft of hyphae. The root weight and branching were
increased in inoculated seedlings. The culture filtrates from the liquid cultures of B.
merulioides and Pisolithus tinctorius were analyzed. Both fungi produced measureable
quantities of indole-3-acetic acid. The results show that IAA is the compound responsible
for the dichotomization in the short roots of P. densiflora. Key words: Boletinellus

technologies in the manufacture of lumber and plywood is one area that always competes for

looks at the importance of adopting innovative processing technologies on a firm's
performance by grouping firms producing softwood lumber and plywood using a hierarchical
clustering technique and then profiling these firms using descriptive statistics. This
technique, using firm controllable strategic variables as clustering criteria, is rarely
used in the forest products industry. Thirty-eight firms, responsible for over 30% of 1987
North American softwood lumber production and over 70% of softwood plywood production,
provided empirical evidence that increased adoption of innovative processing technologies
was linked to superior performance. Companies with high levels of adoption were gaining
market share. Firms with low levels of adoption were losing market share. There was no
correlation between firm size and degree of forward vertical integration. Strong support
for building products firms to allocate resources for the development and adoption of new
and innovative processing technologies is one of the strategic implications of this

																																					Abstract
The parent alkali beam and the crossed thermal beams of the K, Rb, Cs and CC14 have been
measured with respect to the parent alkali beam. The differential cross section is a
function of recoil velocity and cm angle in the center-of-mass coordinate system. The
transformation is carried out directly by selecting a single representative velocity in
each of the parent beams. The other method does not use the c.m. The coefficients
determined by a least-squares fit to the experimental data are represented by a many-term
polynomial in powers of ucose and usine. The cross sections of the two methods agree and
confirm the qualitative interpretation of previous experiments. The results obtained for
stripping the reactions of alkali atoms with halogens show a strong correlation between
the two peaks. As E' increases and K Rb Cs increases, the pattern shifts toward the
forward hemisphere. The results are correlated by a modification of the spectator model
and a phenomenological analysis similar to that used for the rainbow effect in elastic

The survival value of different parts of the Redwinged Blackbird was determined by
comparing the factors that affect it in marsh and upland breeding habitats. The hypothesis
that Redwings are being excluded from their optimal niche space is supported by the
results. colony size, breeding density, and synchrony were greater in marsh than upland
habitat. The proportion of active nests that were successful, number of young fledged per
active nest, and number fledged per egg were all measures of nest success. The lower
reproductive success of upland populations was caused by a larger proportion of nest
destruction. The marsh's predation pressure was negatively correlated with the depth of
water beneath the nest, providing an anti-predator barrier that upland populations are
unable to achieve. The swamping effect on local predator populations is a result of the
synchrony and greater density of nesting in the marsh. Growth rates, weight at fledging,
and the number fledged per successful nest were similar in the two habi- tats indicating

																																					Abstract
Redwings in marshes tend to be more active than colonies in upland habitats, but the
duration of their activity is longer in large colonies. The variation in timing is
probably related to the vegetation in the habitat and not the size of the colony. The
Redwings' survival value was reduced due to the presence of a large number of prey in the
colonies studied. In large colonies, the percentage of nests predated was lower. During
the peak of the activity, the percentage of predated nests was lower in most colonies. The
Holling model can be applied to different sized colonies. Colony size is probably limited
by a territorial system that protects adequate resources. Smaller colonies might suffer

Increasing sophistication and precision of experimental tests of relativistic gravitation
theories has led to the need for a detailed. The Parametrized Post-Newtonian formalism
treats the post-Newtonian limit of arbitrary metric theories of gravity in terms of nine
metric parameters, whose values vary from theory to theory. The de- tailed definitions and
equations for the formalism are given, as well as the theoretical and experimental founda-
tions of the PPN formalism. According to some metric theories of gravity, a massive, self-
gravitating body's passive gravitational mass should not be equal to its inertial mass,
but should be an anisotropic tensor which depends on the body's self-gravitational energy.
The PPN formalism's theoretical structure is probed by two theorems. They state that a
metric theory of gravity has post-Newtonian integral conser- vation laws if and only if
its nine PPN parameters have values which satisfy a set of seven constraint equations.

belong to the person. It was printed in the U.S.A. The first in a series of theoretical
papers will discuss the experimental foundations of general relativity. The paper reviews,
modifies, and compares two very different theoretical frameworks. The Dicke framework
doesn\'t take into account the nature of gravity or the gross features of the interaction.
The postulates of the Parametrized Post- Neacionian framework are the two tentative
conclusions. Most of the theories of gravity that are compatible with experiment are
covered by the PPN framework. Future papers in this series will develop the PPN framework
in detail, and use it to analyze a variety of relativistic effects that should be visible
in the solar system during the coming decade. Since 1963, a number of discoveries and
observations have forced Astro- physicists to make general relativity a working tool in
their theoretical model building. It would be naive to think that the very astronomical
phenomena in which rela- tivistic gravity is crucial will provide the answer. The local
behavior of matter and magnetic fields are interwoven with the effects of gravity waves.
There is no hope of getting clean tests of the nature of gravity if they are separated.
The astrophysical enterprise uses the laws of gravity as an input and tries to get out in
for- mation about what the matter and fields are doing. The greatest hopes for clean tests
of gravity lie in space and laboratory technology. The National Science Foundation and the
Office of Naval Research supported the project. Theoretical Frameworks for Testing
Relativistic Gravity is the first paper in the series. The papers in this series will tend
to be theoretical and mathematical, with the exception of the present one. ""Relativistic
Gravity in the Solar System"" will be a companion series. It will look at the nature of
various effects and their prospects for detection in the next few decades. My students and

foundation for the ""PPN framework"" developed and used in this series of papers.

with previous calculations. In Paper I of this series (Thorne and Will 1971), the
theoretical and experimental foundations for metric theories of gravity were described,
and qualitative aspects of the Parametrized Post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism were discussed.
There are postulates that there exists a metric of signature -2 which governs proper
length and proper time measurements, and that the response of stressed matter to gravity
be described by the equation V.T. The covariant derivative with respect to the metric is
V, and the total stress- energy tensor is T. In this paper, a series of metric parameters
will be used to develop the PPN formalism for perfect fluids. The ""Nordtvedt effect"" is a
rela- tivistic gravity problem. The principle of equivalence is violated by theNordtvedt
effect. According to a wide class of metric theories of gravity, different massive bodies
should fall with different accelerations. This means that the body\'s mass is no longer
equal to its weight. If m is the center mass of the body, a is the acceleration of its
center mass, and U is the external (Newtonian) potential, it can be measured by means of a
test. Permission was granted for this reproduced by the copyright owner. Permission is

earth models. Higher Love modes can be excited to the fundamental mode for both shallow
and deep sources under a variety of circum- stances, and thus higher mode interference is
an important factor to be taken into account in the proper interpretation and analysis of

contamination on measured phase velocities, and biases in the selection and analysis of
surface wave data make it appear likely that fundamental mode Love waves experiencing
higher mode inter-ference will exhibit high apparent phase velocities. It may not be

The basic observation of this study is that seismograms written in southern California
from earthquakes within the northern Gulf of California are different from those of most.
There is a visual difference between the Baja sources and the Gulf seismograms. This is
thought to be a source effect, reflecting the relatively small source dimen- sions and low
seismic moments of the Baja earthquakes. In principle, the differences in the seismograms
could be caused by a near-source or propagation path effect, but the similarity in paths
and the large magnitude of the observed difference argue against this explanation. There
are some North Baja sources with large moments and source dimensions that show that
different seismograms are produced by different sources. Preliminary examination of
seismo- grams from events within southern California suggests the same kinds of regional
variations there. The Northern Baja earthquakes have source dimensions at least a factor
of four smaller and seismic moments, an order of magnitude less than events of similar

The linear dynamic viscoelastic behavior of free films and lap-shear bonded metal joints
were compared. They investigated thermosetting and thermoplastics. There was a mechanical
dispersion occurring at higher temperatures in the bonds. Sample preparation is an
important part of the evaluation of bonding materials. The role of evaluating proper
material response functions and their connection to joint failure events is one of the
clear roles of a total systems analysis approach to adhesive bonding. The desire to
explore a particular response function, the linear viscoelastic quantity tan 8, was the
motivation for this work. The tan 6 function for 7 is associated with the dispersions of

The thermal and dynamic mechanical behavior of triblock copolymers with a
styrene/isoprene/styrene architecture were investigated. The thermal and mechanicl
response of films bonding together two titanium alloy plates was dependent on joint
preparation. The presence of residual stresses in thin films which had been cooled while
under high pressure was felt to contribute to the observed phenomena. It's well known that
viscoelastic stress fields are developed in molten polymer. A cooling process may lead to
anisotropic mechanical properties. Studies showing the effects of residual stresses and
impact failure behavior on the structure-property relationships in oriented polymeric
solids point out the possible subtlety of that. The work done in our laboratory shows
anisotropic behavior with respect to 43.

CHAPTER IV APPLICATION OF COMPRESSIVE CREEP COMPLIANCE MASTER CURVES IS A PREDICTIVE TOOL

exist in this series of radial block copolymers, and partial mixing of the component

																																					Abstract
A series of hydrogenated forms of p-tert-butylstyrene and isoprene radial block copolymers
were investigated. The isoprene phase converts the p-tert-butylstyrene and isoprene radial
block into essentially a p-tert-butylstyrene block plus an ethylene propylene alternating.
It is important that this operation converts a pair of block components into a system that
is likely to have a high degree of microphase separation. The series is an excellent model
system to study. The degree of microphase separation was influenced by the degree of
hydrogenation. Consideration was given to the physical properties of the diene originating
segment, having extreme compositions of polyisoprene and an ethylene propylene alternating
as well as a number of partially unsaturated versions. The investigation shows that it was
possible to control tack and holding power.

Cool-season perennial grass productivity plummets during hot, dry weather. In the United
States and especially in the Southeast, there has been a summer slump. Perennial, tall-
growing, warm- season forage grasses produce abundant herbage during the summer and could
make a contribution to southeastern systems. The relatively long period required to
produce grazable stands of warm-season grasses is problematic. Problems with establishment
need to be investigated before these warm-season species can be incorporated into a summer
system. Research was done to evaluate the influence of limestone, P, and carbofuran on the
establishment of switchgrass. The killed sod in Blacksburg, VA is located at 610 m

the data to estimate the AG and AH, of other silicate minerals from a weighted sum of the
contribution of each oxide and hydroxide component. The method outlined here can be used
to estimate the thermodynamic properties of silicate phases which are too complex or

associated average residuals of 0.26% and 0.24%. The average difference between the

The effect of copper on the activity of the tyrannosaurus rex is studied. Two of the
fungi, Pisolithus tinctorius and Boletinellus merulioides, have naturally brown pigmented
hyphae. The hyphae were developed in the presence of copper. The extracellular tyrosinase
produced by S. pictus was 60 g/g copper. The yellow and black hyphae of Piloderma bicolor
and Cenococcum graniforme were unaffected by copper. The activity of P. tinctorius and S.
granulatus decreased when they were grown under copper stress. The reaction mixture was
activated and repressed by the addition of the polyamines putrescine and spermidine. The
Polyamine content of P. tinctorius and B. merulioides was not altered by the addition of
copper. A decrease in the polyamine content may indicate a change in the permeability of
the cells. Key words are copper and polyamines. Copper can be toxic at relatively low
concentrations, but is essential for normal growth and development. The availability of

Boletinellus merulioides. Piloderma bicolor was very tolerant. The copper ion was
deposited outside the cell wall in S. pictus and inside the cell wall in P. tintorius. The

subsequent improvement of host plant growth in such a diverse group of organisms. Key
words are copper, ultrastructure, tolerance, polysaccharides, cell walls and
ectomycorrhizae. The growth of other organisms is severely restricted by the ability of
some fungi to grow at high levels of copper. A number of mechanisms of copper tolerance
can be found in the fungi. The production and deposition of copper oxalate in the
extracellular hyphal sheath of some wood-rotting fungi is one example. There is a

There is an effect of copper on the growth of Pinus densiflora. Host growth at both 0 and
15 g/g copper was improved by Suillus pictus. There was no correlation between growth
under metal stress in pure culture and whether the fungus is an early or late stage
colonizer of the host. Mycorrhizal colonization was decreased by copper, but not by
Pisolithus tinctorius and P. bicolor. There was more branching in the presence of metal if
a fungus caused the host to produce branched mycorrhizal short roots. A decrease in copper
lost from mycorrhizal roots when compared to nonmycorrhizal roots was found in all of the
fungi tested. Mycorrhizal colonization increased root and shoot levels, and the increase
was most noticeable at higher copper levels. The percent of vascular tissue in the trees
was decreased by copper. colonization with P. tinctorius caused copper to be in the shoot.
It was likely that both symbionts were responsible for the formation of the mycorrhizal
association. When two fungi were present on the same host, copper altered the ratio of
short root branching patterns. There are different ways in which heavy metal stress
affects ectomycorrhizal fungi. Colonization of tree roots by aycorrhizal partner can
improve the growth of the tree in metal contaminated soil. When grown in high metal media,

be mycorrhizal. Pinus densiflora, a non host tree, was in- oculated with cultures of B.
merulioides. Shoot weights were not increased by inoculation. Short roots lacked root
hairs and had an internal structure similar to that of anycorrhizal rootlets. The short
roots were surrounded by a loose weft of hyphae. The root weight and branching were
increased in inoculated seedlings. The culture filtrates from the liquid cultures of B.
merulioides and Pisolithus tinctorius were analyzed. Both fungi produced measureable

																																					Abstract
In 1988 wood products firms responsible for over one third of the structural panel
production and two thirds of the softwood lumber in Canada and the United States were
surveyed to produce an inventory of new processing technologies adopted for each of these
wood products segments. Oriented strandboard and waferboard were included in the
structural panels. The proportion of 1987 production that used each technology was
measured by the Use Intensity index. For different technologies, use intensity ranged from
less than 1% to more than 90%. Multivariate statistical analysis was used to find out
which technologies were compatible with each other. Different directions for forest and
wood science research can be developed with knowledge of these changes in wood processing.
The inventory can be used to explore areas for future technological innovation in the
processing of the forest resource. 64

																																					Abstract
For a firm to remain competitive, it must allocate its limited financial resources into
areas that will maintain or improve its performance. The adoption of innovative process
technologies in the manufacture of lumber and plywood is one area that always competes for
resources. Adoption's impact on a firm's performance has never been studied. This paper
looks at the importance of adopting innovative processing technologies on a firm's
performance by grouping firms producing softwood lumber and plywood using a hierarchical
clustering technique and then profiling these firms using descriptive statistics. This
technique, using firm controllable strategic variables as clustering criteria, is rarely
used in the forest products industry. Thirty-eight firms, responsible for over 30% of 1987
North American softwood lumber production and over 70% of softwood plywood production,
provided empirical evidence that increased adoption of innovative processing technologies
was linked to superior performance. Companies with high levels of adoption were gaining
market share. Firms with low levels of adoption were losing market share. There was no
correlation between firm size and degree of forward vertical integration. Strong support
for building products firms to allocate resources for the development and adoption of new
and innovative processing technologies is one of the strategic implications of this
research. 81

The parent alkali beam and the crossed thermal beams of the K, Rb, Cs and CC14 have been
measured with respect to the parent alkali beam. The differential cross section is a
function of recoil velocity and cm angle in the center-of-mass coordinate system. The
transformation is carried out directly by selecting a single representative velocity in
each of the parent beams. The other method does not use the c.m. The coefficients
determined by a least-squares fit to the experimental data are represented by a many-term
polynomial in powers of ucose and usine. The cross sections of the two methods agree and
confirm the qualitative interpretation of previous experiments. The results obtained for
stripping the reactions of alkali atoms with halogens show a strong correlation between
the two peaks. As E' increases and K Rb Cs increases, the pattern shifts toward the
forward hemisphere. The results are correlated by a modification of the spectator model

The survival value of different parts of the Redwinged Blackbird was determined by
comparing the factors that affect it in marsh and upland breeding habitats. The hypothesis
that Redwings are being excluded from their optimal niche space is supported by the
results. colony size, breeding density, and synchrony were greater in marsh than upland
habitat. The proportion of active nests that were successful, number of young fledged per
active nest, and number fledged per egg were all measures of nest success. The lower
reproductive success of upland populations was caused by a larger proportion of nest
destruction. The marsh's predation pressure was negatively correlated with the depth of
water beneath the nest, providing an anti-predator barrier that upland populations are
unable to achieve. The swamping effect on local predator populations is a result of the
synchrony and greater density of nesting in the marsh. Growth rates, weight at fledging,

																																					Abstract
Redwings in marshes tend to be more active than colonies in upland habitats, but the
duration of their activity is longer in large colonies. The variation in timing is
probably related to the vegetation in the habitat and not the size of the colony. The
Redwings' survival value was reduced due to the presence of a large number of prey in the
colonies studied. In large colonies, the percentage of nests predated was lower. During
the peak of the activity, the percentage of predated nests was lower in most colonies. The
Holling model can be applied to different sized colonies. Colony size is probably limited
by a territorial system that protects adequate resources. Smaller colonies might suffer

Increasing sophistication and precision of experimental tests of relativistic gravitation
theories has led to the need for a detailed. The Parametrized Post-Newtonian formalism
treats the post-Newtonian limit of arbitrary metric theories of gravity in terms of nine
metric parameters, whose values vary from theory to theory. The de- tailed definitions and
equations for the formalism are given, as well as the theoretical and experimental founda-
tions of the PPN formalism. According to some metric theories of gravity, a massive, self-
gravitating body's passive gravitational mass should not be equal to its inertial mass,
but should be an anisotropic tensor which depends on the body's self-gravitational energy.
The PPN formalism's theoretical structure is probed by two theorems. They state that a
metric theory of gravity has post-Newtonian integral conser- vation laws if and only if
its nine PPN parameters have values which satisfy a set of seven constraint equations.

belong to the person. It was printed in the U.S.A. The first in a series of theoretical
papers will discuss the experimental foundations of general relativity. The paper reviews,
modifies, and compares two very different theoretical frameworks. The Dicke framework
doesn\'t take into account the nature of gravity or the gross features of the interaction.
The postulates of the Parametrized Post- Neacionian framework are the two tentative
conclusions. Most of the theories of gravity that are compatible with experiment are
covered by the PPN framework. Future papers in this series will develop the PPN framework
in detail, and use it to analyze a variety of relativistic effects that should be visible
in the solar system during the coming decade. Since 1963, a number of discoveries and
observations have forced Astro- physicists to make general relativity a working tool in
their theoretical model building. It would be naive to think that the very astronomical
phenomena in which rela- tivistic gravity is crucial will provide the answer. The local
behavior of matter and magnetic fields are interwoven with the effects of gravity waves.
There is no hope of getting clean tests of the nature of gravity if they are separated.
The astrophysical enterprise uses the laws of gravity as an input and tries to get out in
for- mation about what the matter and fields are doing. The greatest hopes for clean tests
of gravity lie in space and laboratory technology. The National Science Foundation and the
Office of Naval Research supported the project. Theoretical Frameworks for Testing
Relativistic Gravity is the first paper in the series. The papers in this series will tend
to be theoretical and mathematical, with the exception of the present one. ""Relativistic
Gravity in the Solar System"" will be a companion series. It will look at the nature of
various effects and their prospects for detection in the next few decades. My students and

equivalence principle is violated in Brans-Dicke theory when the two mass differ by a
small isotropic correction. The two results are explained. The work generalizes and agrees
with previous calculations. In Paper I of this series (Thorne and Will 1971), the
theoretical and experimental foundations for metric theories of gravity were described,
and qualitative aspects of the Parametrized Post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism were discussed.
There are postulates that there exists a metric of signature -2 which governs proper
length and proper time measurements, and that the response of stressed matter to gravity
be described by the equation V.T. The covariant derivative with respect to the metric is
V, and the total stress- energy tensor is T. In this paper, a series of metric parameters
will be used to develop the PPN formalism for perfect fluids. The ""Nordtvedt effect"" is a
rela- tivistic gravity problem. The principle of equivalence is violated by theNordtvedt
effect. According to a wide class of metric theories of gravity, different massive bodies
should fall with different accelerations. This means that the body\'s mass is no longer
equal to its weight. If m is the center mass of the body, a is the acceleration of its
center mass, and U is the external (Newtonian) potential, it can be measured by means of a

																																					Abstract
There is a significant range of frequencies for a representative selection of spherical
earth models. Higher Love modes can be excited to the fundamental mode for both shallow
and deep sources under a variety of circum- stances, and thus higher mode interference is
an important factor to be taken into account in the proper interpretation and analysis of
Love waves. Simple theoretical computations reveal the nature of the effect of mode
contamination on measured phase velocities, and biases in the selection and analysis of
surface wave data make it appear likely that fundamental mode Love waves experiencing
higher mode inter-ference will exhibit high apparent phase velocities. It may not be
necessary to use complex or anisotropic models to explain the observations. The effects of
mode interference, as well as knowledge of source parameters, are reproduced with

																																					Abstract
The seismology study of an ocean ridge earthquake swarm in the Gulf of California in 1969
has provided new information. Similar to a foreshock-mainshock-after shock sequence, but
with a ""mainshock"" composed of over 70 events with magnitudes between 4 and 6 and
occurring in a six hour period about a day after swarm activity was initiated. Many events
greater than magnitude 5 continued for over two weeks. All sources are within 10 km of
each other and hypocenters are confined to the upper crust, according to near-source
travel time data. Teleseismic P-delays for rays travelling beneath this ridge may be
interpreted in terms of an upper mantle with compressional velocities five to ten per cent
less than normal mantle to a depth of 200 km. Average apparent stresses for all swarm
events are very similar, show no consistent pattern as a function of time, and are close
to values obtained from other ridges. A large component of normal faulting is shown in the
focal mechanism solution. The nodal planes common to this mecha were reproduced with

																																					Abstract
The basic observation of this study is that seismograms written in southern California
from earthquakes within the northern Gulf of California are different from those of most.
There is a visual difference between the Baja sources and the Gulf seismograms. This is
thought to be a source effect, reflecting the relatively small source dimen- sions and low
seismic moments of the Baja earthquakes. In principle, the differences in the seismograms
could be caused by a near-source or propagation path effect, but the similarity in paths
and the large magnitude of the observed difference argue against this explanation. There
are some North Baja sources with large moments and source dimensions that show that
different seismograms are produced by different sources. Preliminary examination of
seismo- grams from events within southern California suggests the same kinds of regional
variations there. The Northern Baja earthquakes have source dimensions at least a factor
of four smaller and seismic moments, an order of magnitude less than events of similar
local magnitude within Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Permission is

The thermal and dynamic mechanical behavior of triblock copolymers with a
styrene/isoprene/styrene architecture were investigated. The thermal and mechanicl
response of films bonding together two titanium alloy plates was dependent on joint
preparation. The presence of residual stresses in thin films which had been cooled while
under high pressure was felt to contribute to the observed phenomena. It's well known that
viscoelastic stress fields are developed in molten polymer. A cooling process may lead to
anisotropic mechanical properties. Studies showing the effects of residual stresses and

A series of hydrogenated forms of p-tert-butylstyrene and isoprene radial block copolymers
were investigated. The isoprene phase converts the p-tert-butylstyrene and isoprene radial
block into essentially a p-tert-butylstyrene block plus an ethylene propylene alternating.
It is important that this operation converts a pair of block components into a system that
is likely to have a high degree of microphase separation. The series is an excellent model
system to study. The degree of microphase separation was influenced by the degree of
hydrogenation. Consideration was given to the physical properties of the diene originating

as well as a number of partially unsaturated versions. The investigation shows that it was

Cool-season perennial grass productivity plummets during hot, dry weather. In the United
States and especially in the Southeast, there has been a summer slump. Perennial, tall-
growing, warm- season forage grasses produce abundant herbage during the summer and could
make a contribution to southeastern systems. The relatively long period required to

need to be investigated before these warm-season species can be incorporated into a summer

hyphae. The hyphae were developed in the presence of copper. The extracellular tyrosinase
produced by S. pictus was 60 g/g copper. The yellow and black hyphae of Piloderma bicolor

activated and repressed by the addition of the polyamines putrescine and spermidine. The

subsequent improvement of host plant growth in such a diverse group of organisms. Key
words are copper, ultrastructure, tolerance, polysaccharides, cell walls and

There is an effect of copper on the growth of Pinus densiflora. Host growth at both 0 and
15 g/g copper was improved by Suillus pictus. There was no correlation between growth
under metal stress in pure culture and whether the fungus is an early or late stage
colonizer of the host. Mycorrhizal colonization was decreased by copper, but not by
Pisolithus tinctorius and P. bicolor. There was more branching in the presence of metal if
a fungus caused the host to produce branched mycorrhizal short roots. A decrease in copper
lost from mycorrhizal roots when compared to nonmycorrhizal roots was found in all of the
fungi tested. Mycorrhizal colonization increased root and shoot levels, and the increase
was most noticeable at higher copper levels. The percent of vascular tissue in the trees
was decreased by copper. colonization with P. tinctorius caused copper to be in the shoot.
It was likely that both symbionts were responsible for the formation of the mycorrhizal
association. When two fungi were present on the same host, copper altered the ratio of
short root branching patterns. There are different ways in which heavy metal stress
affects ectomycorrhizal fungi. Colonization of tree roots by aycorrhizal partner can
improve the growth of the tree in metal contaminated soil. When grown in high metal media,

In 1988 wood products firms responsible for over one third of the structural panel
production and two thirds of the softwood lumber in Canada and the United States were
surveyed to produce an inventory of new processing technologies adopted for each of these
wood products segments. Oriented strandboard and waferboard were included in the
structural panels. The proportion of 1987 production that used each technology was
measured by the Use Intensity index. For different technologies, use intensity ranged from
less than 1% to more than 90%. Multivariate statistical analysis was used to find out
which technologies were compatible with each other. Different directions for forest and
wood science research can be developed with knowledge of these changes in wood processing.
The inventory can be used to explore areas for future technological innovation in the

																																					Abstract
For a firm to remain competitive, it must allocate its limited financial resources into
areas that will maintain or improve its performance. The adoption of innovative process
technologies in the manufacture of lumber and plywood is one area that always competes for
resources. Adoption's impact on a firm's performance has never been studied. This paper
looks at the importance of adopting innovative processing technologies on a firm's
performance by grouping firms producing softwood lumber and plywood using a hierarchical
clustering technique and then profiling these firms using descriptive statistics. This
technique, using firm controllable strategic variables as clustering criteria, is rarely
used in the forest products industry. Thirty-eight firms, responsible for over 30% of 1987
North American softwood lumber production and over 70% of softwood plywood production,
provided empirical evidence that increased adoption of innovative processing technologies
was linked to superior performance. Companies with high levels of adoption were gaining
market share. Firms with low levels of adoption were losing market share. There was no
correlation between firm size and degree of forward vertical integration. Strong support
for building products firms to allocate resources for the development and adoption of new
and innovative processing technologies is one of the strategic implications of this
research. 81

The parent alkali beam and the crossed thermal beams of the K, Rb, Cs and CC14 have been
measured with respect to the parent alkali beam. The differential cross section is a
function of recoil velocity and cm angle in the center-of-mass coordinate system. The
transformation is carried out directly by selecting a single representative velocity in
each of the parent beams. The other method does not use the c.m. The coefficients
determined by a least-squares fit to the experimental data are represented by a many-term
polynomial in powers of ucose and usine. The cross sections of the two methods agree and
confirm the qualitative interpretation of previous experiments. The results obtained for
stripping the reactions of alkali atoms with halogens show a strong correlation between
the two peaks. As E' increases and K Rb Cs increases, the pattern shifts toward the
forward hemisphere. The results are correlated by a modification of the spectator model

The survival value of different parts of the Redwinged Blackbird was determined by
comparing the factors that affect it in marsh and upland breeding habitats. The hypothesis
that Redwings are being excluded from their optimal niche space is supported by the
results. colony size, breeding density, and synchrony were greater in marsh than upland
habitat. The proportion of active nests that were successful, number of young fledged per
active nest, and number fledged per egg were all measures of nest success. The lower
reproductive success of upland populations was caused by a larger proportion of nest
destruction. The marsh's predation pressure was negatively correlated with the depth of
water beneath the nest, providing an anti-predator barrier that upland populations are
unable to achieve. The swamping effect on local predator populations is a result of the
synchrony and greater density of nesting in the marsh. Growth rates, weight at fledging,

Redwings in marshes tend to be more active than colonies in upland habitats, but the
duration of their activity is longer in large colonies. The variation in timing is
probably related to the vegetation in the habitat and not the size of the colony. The
Redwings' survival value was reduced due to the presence of a large number of prey in the
colonies studied. In large colonies, the percentage of nests predated was lower. During
the peak of the activity, the percentage of predated nests was lower in most colonies. The
Holling model can be applied to different sized colonies. Colony size is probably limited
by a territorial system that protects adequate resources. Smaller colonies might suffer

Increasing sophistication and precision of experimental tests of relativistic gravitation
theories has led to the need for a detailed. The Parametrized Post-Newtonian formalism
treats the post-Newtonian limit of arbitrary metric theories of gravity in terms of nine
metric parameters, whose values vary from theory to theory. The de- tailed definitions and
equations for the formalism are given, as well as the theoretical and experimental founda-
tions of the PPN formalism. According to some metric theories of gravity, a massive, self-
gravitating body's passive gravitational mass should not be equal to its inertial mass,
but should be an anisotropic tensor which depends on the body's self-gravitational energy.
The PPN formalism's theoretical structure is probed by two theorems. They state that a
metric theory of gravity has post-Newtonian integral conser- vation laws if and only if
its nine PPN parameters have values which satisfy a set of seven constraint equations.

TheASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL was published in 1971 The University of Chicago. All rights
belong to the person. It was printed in the U.S.A. The first in a series of theoretical
papers will discuss the experimental foundations of general relativity. The paper reviews,
modifies, and compares two very different theoretical frameworks. The Dicke framework
doesn\'t take into account the nature of gravity or the gross features of the interaction.
The postulates of the Parametrized Post- Neacionian framework are the two tentative
conclusions. Most of the theories of gravity that are compatible with experiment are
covered by the PPN framework. Future papers in this series will develop the PPN framework
in detail, and use it to analyze a variety of relativistic effects that should be visible
in the solar system during the coming decade. Since 1963, a number of discoveries and
observations have forced Astro- physicists to make general relativity a working tool in
their theoretical model building. It would be naive to think that the very astronomical
phenomena in which rela- tivistic gravity is crucial will provide the answer. The local
behavior of matter and magnetic fields are interwoven with the effects of gravity waves.
There is no hope of getting clean tests of the nature of gravity if they are separated.
The astrophysical enterprise uses the laws of gravity as an input and tries to get out in
for- mation about what the matter and fields are doing. The greatest hopes for clean tests
of gravity lie in space and laboratory technology. The National Science Foundation and the
Office of Naval Research supported the project. Theoretical Frameworks for Testing
Relativistic Gravity is the first paper in the series. The papers in this series will tend
to be theoretical and mathematical, with the exception of the present one. ""Relativistic
Gravity in the Solar System"" will be a companion series. It will look at the nature of
various effects and their prospects for detection in the next few decades. My students and
I dedicate this series of papers to Professor S. Chandrasekhar. Professor Chandrasekhar\'s

equivalence principle is violated in Brans-Dicke theory when the two mass differ by a
small isotropic correction. The two results are explained. The work generalizes and agrees
with previous calculations. In Paper I of this series (Thorne and Will 1971), the
theoretical and experimental foundations for metric theories of gravity were described,
and qualitative aspects of the Parametrized Post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism were discussed.
There are postulates that there exists a metric of signature -2 which governs proper
length and proper time measurements, and that the response of stressed matter to gravity
be described by the equation V.T. The covariant derivative with respect to the metric is
V, and the total stress- energy tensor is T. In this paper, a series of metric parameters
will be used to develop the PPN formalism for perfect fluids. The ""Nordtvedt effect"" is a
rela- tivistic gravity problem. The principle of equivalence is violated by theNordtvedt
effect. According to a wide class of metric theories of gravity, different massive bodies
should fall with different accelerations. This means that the body\'s mass is no longer
equal to its weight. If m is the center mass of the body, a is the acceleration of its
center mass, and U is the external (Newtonian) potential, it can be measured by means of a
test. Permission was granted for this reproduced by the copyright owner. Permission is

The Gulf of California region has been determined using a combination of surface wave

illuminate structure for five sets of paths in and adjacent to the Gulf. Baja California
and Sonora have the same crustal thicknesses. Love wave group velocities for Baja paths
are high with respect to values expected but not used to determine structure. Short period
higher mode waves give a good constraint on the average thickness beneath Baja. There is a

																																					Abstract
There is a significant range of frequencies for a representative selection of spherical
earth models. Higher Love modes can be excited to the fundamental mode for both shallow
and deep sources under a variety of circum- stances, and thus higher mode interference is
an important factor to be taken into account in the proper interpretation and analysis of
Love waves. Simple theoretical computations reveal the nature of the effect of mode
contamination on measured phase velocities, and biases in the selection and analysis of
surface wave data make it appear likely that fundamental mode Love waves experiencing
higher mode inter-ference will exhibit high apparent phase velocities. It may not be
necessary to use complex or anisotropic models to explain the observations. The effects of
mode interference, as well as knowledge of source parameters, are reproduced with

																																					Abstract
The seismology study of an ocean ridge earthquake swarm in the Gulf of California in 1969
has provided new information. Similar to a foreshock-mainshock-after shock sequence, but
with a ""mainshock"" composed of over 70 events with magnitudes between 4 and 6 and
occurring in a six hour period about a day after swarm activity was initiated. Many events
greater than magnitude 5 continued for over two weeks. All sources are within 10 km of
each other and hypocenters are confined to the upper crust, according to near-source
travel time data. Teleseismic P-delays for rays travelling beneath this ridge may be
interpreted in terms of an upper mantle with compressional velocities five to ten per cent
less than normal mantle to a depth of 200 km. Average apparent stresses for all swarm
events are very similar, show no consistent pattern as a function of time, and are close
to values obtained from other ridges. A large component of normal faulting is shown in the
focal mechanism solution. The nodal planes common to this mecha were reproduced with

																																					Abstract
The basic observation of this study is that seismograms written in southern California
from earthquakes within the northern Gulf of California are different from those of most.
There is a visual difference between the Baja sources and the Gulf seismograms. This is
thought to be a source effect, reflecting the relatively small source dimen- sions and low
seismic moments of the Baja earthquakes. In principle, the differences in the seismograms
could be caused by a near-source or propagation path effect, but the similarity in paths
and the large magnitude of the observed difference argue against this explanation. There
are some North Baja sources with large moments and source dimensions that show that
different seismograms are produced by different sources. Preliminary examination of
seismo- grams from events within southern California suggests the same kinds of regional
variations there. The Northern Baja earthquakes have source dimensions at least a factor
of four smaller and seismic moments, an order of magnitude less than events of similar
local magnitude within Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Permission is

were compared. They investigated thermosetting and thermoplastics. There was a mechanical
dispersion occurring at higher temperatures in the bonds. Sample preparation is an
important part of the evaluation of bonding materials. The role of evaluating proper
material response functions and their connection to joint failure events is one of the
clear roles of a total systems analysis approach to adhesive bonding. The desire to
explore a particular response function, the linear viscoelastic quantity tan 8, was the

The thermal and dynamic mechanical behavior of triblock copolymers with a
styrene/isoprene/styrene architecture were investigated. The thermal and mechanicl
response of films bonding together two titanium alloy plates was dependent on joint
preparation. The presence of residual stresses in thin films which had been cooled while
under high pressure was felt to contribute to the observed phenomena. It's well known that
viscoelastic stress fields are developed in molten polymer. A cooling process may lead to
anisotropic mechanical properties. Studies showing the effects of residual stresses and
impact failure behavior on the structure-property relationships in oriented polymeric
solids point out the possible subtlety of that. The work done in our laboratory shows

A series of hydrogenated forms of p-tert-butylstyrene and isoprene radial block copolymers
were investigated. The isoprene phase converts the p-tert-butylstyrene and isoprene radial
block into essentially a p-tert-butylstyrene block plus an ethylene propylene alternating.
It is important that this operation converts a pair of block components into a system that
is likely to have a high degree of microphase separation. The series is an excellent model
system to study. The degree of microphase separation was influenced by the degree of
hydrogenation. Consideration was given to the physical properties of the diene originating
segment, having extreme compositions of polyisoprene and an ethylene propylene alternating
as well as a number of partially unsaturated versions. The investigation shows that it was
possible to control tack and holding power.

less vulnerable to weed competition, methods are needed. The two tall-growing, perennial,

																																					Abstract
Cool-season perennial grass productivity plummets during hot, dry weather. In the United
States and especially in the Southeast, there has been a summer slump. Perennial, tall-
growing, warm- season forage grasses produce abundant herbage during the summer and could
make a contribution to southeastern systems. The relatively long period required to
produce grazable stands of warm-season grasses is problematic. Problems with establishment
need to be investigated before these warm-season species can be incorporated into a summer
system. Research was done to evaluate the influence of limestone, P, and carbofuran on the
establishment of switchgrass. The killed sod in Blacksburg, VA is located at 610 m

contribution of H2O-FeO(6)-Fe(OH) has been determined by multiple regression. We can use
the data to estimate the AG and AH, of other silicate minerals from a weighted sum of the
contribution of each oxide and hydroxide component. The method outlined here can be used
to estimate the thermodynamic properties of silicate phases which are too complex or

associated average residuals of 0.26% and 0.24%. The average difference between the
measured and predicted values of 0.25 for AG for 18 minerals and 0.22 for 20 minerals is

The effect of copper on the activity of the tyrannosaurus rex is studied. Two of the

hyphae. The hyphae were developed in the presence of copper. The extracellular tyrosinase
produced by S. pictus was 60 g/g copper. The yellow and black hyphae of Piloderma bicolor

activated and repressed by the addition of the polyamines putrescine and spermidine. The
Polyamine content of P. tinctorius and B. merulioides was not altered by the addition of

There is an effect of copper on the growth of Pinus densiflora. Host growth at both 0 and
15 g/g copper was improved by Suillus pictus. There was no correlation between growth
under metal stress in pure culture and whether the fungus is an early or late stage
colonizer of the host. Mycorrhizal colonization was decreased by copper, but not by
Pisolithus tinctorius and P. bicolor. There was more branching in the presence of metal if
a fungus caused the host to produce branched mycorrhizal short roots. A decrease in copper
lost from mycorrhizal roots when compared to nonmycorrhizal roots was found in all of the
fungi tested. Mycorrhizal colonization increased root and shoot levels, and the increase
was most noticeable at higher copper levels. The percent of vascular tissue in the trees
was decreased by copper. colonization with P. tinctorius caused copper to be in the shoot.
It was likely that both symbionts were responsible for the formation of the mycorrhizal
association. When two fungi were present on the same host, copper altered the ratio of
short root branching patterns. There are different ways in which heavy metal stress
affects ectomycorrhizal fungi. Colonization of tree roots by aycorrhizal partner can
improve the growth of the tree in metal contaminated soil. When grown in high metal media,

be mycorrhizal. Pinus densiflora, a non host tree, was in- oculated with cultures of B.
merulioides. Shoot weights were not increased by inoculation. Short roots lacked root
hairs and had an internal structure similar to that of anycorrhizal rootlets. The short
roots were surrounded by a loose weft of hyphae. The root weight and branching were
increased in inoculated seedlings. The culture filtrates from the liquid cultures of B.
merulioides and Pisolithus tinctorius were analyzed. Both fungi produced measureable

the soil, the roots were colonized by VA fungi. It is possible that there is an absence of
VA mycorrhizal fungi that is limiting plant growth on abandoned mines in southwest
Virginia and central North Carolina. Colonization of herbaceous plants by vesicular-
arbuscular (VA) mycorrhizal or endomycorrhizal fungi increases the amount of phosphorus in
the soil. Many angiosperms are likely obligately VA mycorrhizal in the soil. VA
mycorrhizae can increase the amount of metalliferous micronutri- ents. The colonization of
host roots by VA mycorrhizal fungi has been shown to decrease or even be eliminated by
high levels of heavy metals in the soil. There are differences between the two types of VA
mycorrhizal spores, and zinc, copper, and manganese may be used to prevent the growth of
them. There is a survey of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on mine spoils.

																																					Abstract
The value of certain chemicals to retard the decline of crab processing waste was studied
in four experiments. Pre- vented degradation of crab processing waste can be achieved with
the addition of 1.5% propionic/formic acid. On day 28, the TMA concentration increased
from 30.76 to 30.77. It went from 40.51% to 47.02% on the dry basis. It is a reflection of
the loss of other components. The waste was ensiled with wheat straw, sugarcane molasses
and water. There was an increase in lactic acid in the silages made with or without
inoculant. With crab waste stored for 2 d, the highest pH and lowest lactic acid
concentration was observed. Residual acids may have restricted the growth of yeast. Crab

It was possible to prevent deterioration up to d 7. When NaOC1 was used, the ratio of TMA
to N/100 g increased from 3.70 to 12.85. When H2O2 was used, the reduction in pH and high
level of lactic acid indicated that the chemicals prevented degradation, and enhanced
fermentation of the crab waste-straw mixture. The crab waste was retarded by.4% NaOC1 and
1.5% acetic acid. The highest and lowest concentration of TMA were found in the NaOH
treated waste. The highest and lowest true protein content was found in the acetic acid
treated waste. The production of NH3 was affected by the use of 1.5% NaOH. The highest
concentration of H2S was found in the waste that was treated with NaOH. The waste was
preserved for a minimum of 10 d with the use of 1% NaNO2 and 4% sodium/calcium

production and two thirds of the softwood lumber in Canada and the United States were
surveyed to produce an inventory of new processing technologies adopted for each of these

less than 1% to more than 90%. Multivariate statistical analysis was used to find out
which technologies were compatible with each other. Different directions for forest and

For a firm to remain competitive, it must allocate its limited financial resources into
areas that will maintain or improve its performance. The adoption of innovative process
technologies in the manufacture of lumber and plywood is one area that always competes for
resources. Adoption's impact on a firm's performance has never been studied. This paper
looks at the importance of adopting innovative processing technologies on a firm's
performance by grouping firms producing softwood lumber and plywood using a hierarchical
clustering technique and then profiling these firms using descriptive statistics. This
technique, using firm controllable strategic variables as clustering criteria, is rarely
used in the forest products industry. Thirty-eight firms, responsible for over 30% of 1987
North American softwood lumber production and over 70% of softwood plywood production,
provided empirical evidence that increased adoption of innovative processing technologies
was linked to superior performance. Companies with high levels of adoption were gaining
market share. Firms with low levels of adoption were losing market share. There was no
correlation between firm size and degree of forward vertical integration. Strong support
for building products firms to allocate resources for the development and adoption of new
and innovative processing technologies is one of the strategic implications of this

The parent alkali beam and the crossed thermal beams of the K, Rb, Cs and CC14 have been
measured with respect to the parent alkali beam. The differential cross section is a
function of recoil velocity and cm angle in the center-of-mass coordinate system. The
transformation is carried out directly by selecting a single representative velocity in
each of the parent beams. The other method does not use the c.m. The coefficients
determined by a least-squares fit to the experimental data are represented by a many-term
polynomial in powers of ucose and usine. The cross sections of the two methods agree and
confirm the qualitative interpretation of previous experiments. The results obtained for
stripping the reactions of alkali atoms with halogens show a strong correlation between
the two peaks. As E' increases and K Rb Cs increases, the pattern shifts toward the
forward hemisphere. The results are correlated by a modification of the spectator model

The survival value of different parts of the Redwinged Blackbird was determined by
comparing the factors that affect it in marsh and upland breeding habitats. The hypothesis
that Redwings are being excluded from their optimal niche space is supported by the
results. colony size, breeding density, and synchrony were greater in marsh than upland
habitat. The proportion of active nests that were successful, number of young fledged per
active nest, and number fledged per egg were all measures of nest success. The lower
reproductive success of upland populations was caused by a larger proportion of nest
destruction. The marsh's predation pressure was negatively correlated with the depth of
water beneath the nest, providing an anti-predator barrier that upland populations are
unable to achieve. The swamping effect on local predator populations is a result of the
synchrony and greater density of nesting in the marsh. Growth rates, weight at fledging,

Redwings in marshes tend to be more active than colonies in upland habitats, but the
duration of their activity is longer in large colonies. The variation in timing is
probably related to the vegetation in the habitat and not the size of the colony. The
Redwings' survival value was reduced due to the presence of a large number of prey in the
colonies studied. In large colonies, the percentage of nests predated was lower. During
the peak of the activity, the percentage of predated nests was lower in most colonies. The
Holling model can be applied to different sized colonies. Colony size is probably limited

marshes makes large, dense colonies possible. There are obvious differences in the
phenology of vegetation used as nest support that are correlated with colony size and

There are some results on the estimation of parameters in differential equations. There is
no need for either the parti- cular solution of the linearized system equation or the
solution of the adjoint equa- tion for continuous observations. Consideration of the
properties of common methods such as quasi linearization at a local minimum of the
objective function, combined with the proposed scheme, is suggested for convergence to the
global minimum. An addi- tional modification of the scheme is presented. The local minimum

																																					Abstract
Increasing sophistication and precision of experimental tests of relativistic gravitation
theories has led to the need for a detailed. The Parametrized Post-Newtonian formalism
treats the post-Newtonian limit of arbitrary metric theories of gravity in terms of nine
metric parameters, whose values vary from theory to theory. The de- tailed definitions and
equations for the formalism are given, as well as the theoretical and experimental founda-
tions of the PPN formalism. According to some metric theories of gravity, a massive, self-
gravitating body's passive gravitational mass should not be equal to its inertial mass,
but should be an anisotropic tensor which depends on the body's self-gravitational energy.
The PPN formalism's theoretical structure is probed by two theorems. They state that a
metric theory of gravity has post-Newtonian integral conser- vation laws if and only if
its nine PPN parameters have values which satisfy a set of seven constraint equations.

																																					Abstract
TheASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL was published in 1971 The University of Chicago. All rights
belong to the person. It was printed in the U.S.A. The first in a series of theoretical
papers will discuss the experimental foundations of general relativity. The paper reviews,
modifies, and compares two very different theoretical frameworks. The Dicke framework
doesn\'t take into account the nature of gravity or the gross features of the interaction.
The postulates of the Parametrized Post- Neacionian framework are the two tentative
conclusions. Most of the theories of gravity that are compatible with experiment are
covered by the PPN framework. Future papers in this series will develop the PPN framework
in detail, and use it to analyze a variety of relativistic effects that should be visible
in the solar system during the coming decade. Since 1963, a number of discoveries and
observations have forced Astro- physicists to make general relativity a working tool in
their theoretical model building. It would be naive to think that the very astronomical
phenomena in which rela- tivistic gravity is crucial will provide the answer. The local
behavior of matter and magnetic fields are interwoven with the effects of gravity waves.
There is no hope of getting clean tests of the nature of gravity if they are separated.
The astrophysical enterprise uses the laws of gravity as an input and tries to get out in
for- mation about what the matter and fields are doing. The greatest hopes for clean tests
of gravity lie in space and laboratory technology. The National Science Foundation and the
Office of Naval Research supported the project. Theoretical Frameworks for Testing
Relativistic Gravity is the first paper in the series. The papers in this series will tend
to be theoretical and mathematical, with the exception of the present one. ""Relativistic
Gravity in the Solar System"" will be a companion series. It will look at the nature of
various effects and their prospects for detection in the next few decades. My students and
I dedicate this series of papers to Professor S. Chandrasekhar. Professor Chandrasekhar\'s
beautiful and systematic development of post-Newtonian hydrodynamics is an indispensable
foundation for the ""PPN framework"" developed and used in this series of papers.

equivalence principle is violated in Brans-Dicke theory when the two mass differ by a
small isotropic correction. The two results are explained. The work generalizes and agrees
with previous calculations. In Paper I of this series (Thorne and Will 1971), the
theoretical and experimental foundations for metric theories of gravity were described,
and qualitative aspects of the Parametrized Post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism were discussed.
There are postulates that there exists a metric of signature -2 which governs proper
length and proper time measurements, and that the response of stressed matter to gravity
be described by the equation V.T. The covariant derivative with respect to the metric is
V, and the total stress- energy tensor is T. In this paper, a series of metric parameters
will be used to develop the PPN formalism for perfect fluids. The ""Nordtvedt effect"" is a
rela- tivistic gravity problem. The principle of equivalence is violated by theNordtvedt
effect. According to a wide class of metric theories of gravity, different massive bodies
should fall with different accelerations. This means that the body\'s mass is no longer
equal to its weight. If m is the center mass of the body, a is the acceleration of its
center mass, and U is the external (Newtonian) potential, it can be measured by means of a
test. Permission was granted for this reproduced by the copyright owner. Permission is

There is a significant range of frequencies for a representative selection of spherical
earth models. Higher Love modes can be excited to the fundamental mode for both shallow
and deep sources under a variety of circum- stances, and thus higher mode interference is
an important factor to be taken into account in the proper interpretation and analysis of
Love waves. Simple theoretical computations reveal the nature of the effect of mode
contamination on measured phase velocities, and biases in the selection and analysis of
surface wave data make it appear likely that fundamental mode Love waves experiencing
higher mode inter-ference will exhibit high apparent phase velocities. It may not be
necessary to use complex or anisotropic models to explain the observations. The effects of

The seismology study of an ocean ridge earthquake swarm in the Gulf of California in 1969
has provided new information. Similar to a foreshock-mainshock-after shock sequence, but

greater than magnitude 5 continued for over two weeks. All sources are within 10 km of
each other and hypocenters are confined to the upper crust, according to near-source
travel time data. Teleseismic P-delays for rays travelling beneath this ridge may be
interpreted in terms of an upper mantle with compressional velocities five to ten per cent
less than normal mantle to a depth of 200 km. Average apparent stresses for all swarm
events are very similar, show no consistent pattern as a function of time, and are close
to values obtained from other ridges. A large component of normal faulting is shown in the

																																					Abstract
The basic observation of this study is that seismograms written in southern California
from earthquakes within the northern Gulf of California are different from those of most.
There is a visual difference between the Baja sources and the Gulf seismograms. This is
thought to be a source effect, reflecting the relatively small source dimen- sions and low
seismic moments of the Baja earthquakes. In principle, the differences in the seismograms
could be caused by a near-source or propagation path effect, but the similarity in paths
and the large magnitude of the observed difference argue against this explanation. There
are some North Baja sources with large moments and source dimensions that show that
different seismograms are produced by different sources. Preliminary examination of
seismo- grams from events within southern California suggests the same kinds of regional
variations there. The Northern Baja earthquakes have source dimensions at least a factor
of four smaller and seismic moments, an order of magnitude less than events of similar
local magnitude within Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Permission is

It is important that this operation converts a pair of block components into a system that

system to study. The degree of microphase separation was influenced by the degree of

There is an effect of copper on the growth of Pinus densiflora. Host growth at both 0 and
15 g/g copper was improved by Suillus pictus. There was no correlation between growth
under metal stress in pure culture and whether the fungus is an early or late stage
colonizer of the host. Mycorrhizal colonization was decreased by copper, but not by
Pisolithus tinctorius and P. bicolor. There was more branching in the presence of metal if
a fungus caused the host to produce branched mycorrhizal short roots. A decrease in copper
lost from mycorrhizal roots when compared to nonmycorrhizal roots was found in all of the
fungi tested. Mycorrhizal colonization increased root and shoot levels, and the increase
was most noticeable at higher copper levels. The percent of vascular tissue in the trees
was decreased by copper. colonization with P. tinctorius caused copper to be in the shoot.
It was likely that both symbionts were responsible for the formation of the mycorrhizal
association. When two fungi were present on the same host, copper altered the ratio of
short root branching patterns. There are different ways in which heavy metal stress
affects ectomycorrhizal fungi. Colonization of tree roots by aycorrhizal partner can
improve the growth of the tree in metal contaminated soil. When grown in high metal media,

hairs and had an internal structure similar to that of anycorrhizal rootlets. The short
roots were surrounded by a loose weft of hyphae. The root weight and branching were

When compared with nonmycorrhizal plants, even at high soil copper levels, there was no
increase in iron and copper. Plants grown in low P soil were so small that comparisons of
mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal plants were not possible. The correlation between
photosynthetic rate and VA mycorrhizal colonization was not found. The results show that
the presence of VA mycorrhizal fungi has no effect on plant growth when exposed to copper.
Colonization of plants by vesicular-arbuscular (VA) or endomycorrhizal fungi stimulates

																																					Abstract
A survey of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on mine spoils was conducted in
southwest Virginia and central North Carolina. Prior to sampling, mining ceased at all
sites. The soil was tested for heavy metal and pH. More than 70% of the root systems
examined were colonized by VA fungi. In 39% of the samples, there were parasites. VA
mycorrhizal fungus was collected by the majority of people. When metals were present in
the soil, the roots were colonized by VA fungi. It is possible that there is an absence of
VA mycorrhizal fungi that is limiting plant growth on abandoned mines in southwest
Virginia and central North Carolina. Colonization of herbaceous plants by vesicular-
arbuscular (VA) mycorrhizal or endomycorrhizal fungi increases the amount of phosphorus in
the soil. Many angiosperms are likely obligately VA mycorrhizal in the soil. VA
mycorrhizae can increase the amount of metalliferous micronutri- ents. The colonization of
host roots by VA mycorrhizal fungi has been shown to decrease or even be eliminated by
high levels of heavy metals in the soil. There are differences between the two types of VA
mycorrhizal spores, and zinc, copper, and manganese may be used to prevent the growth of
them. There is a survey of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on mine spoils.

The value of certain chemicals to retard the decline of crab processing waste was studied
in four experiments. Pre- vented degradation of crab processing waste can be achieved with
the addition of 1.5% propionic/formic acid. On day 28, the TMA concentration increased
from 30.76 to 30.77. It went from 40.51% to 47.02% on the dry basis. It is a reflection of
the loss of other components. The waste was ensiled with wheat straw, sugarcane molasses
and water. There was an increase in lactic acid in the silages made with or without
inoculant. With crab waste stored for 2 d, the highest pH and lowest lactic acid
concentration was observed. Residual acids may have restricted the growth of yeast. Crab

1.5% acetic acid. The highest and lowest concentration of TMA were found in the NaOH

production and two thirds of the softwood lumber in Canada and the United States were
surveyed to produce an inventory of new processing technologies adopted for each of these

measured by the Use Intensity index. For different technologies, use intensity ranged from
less than 1% to more than 90%. Multivariate statistical analysis was used to find out
which technologies were compatible with each other. Different directions for forest and

For a firm to remain competitive, it must allocate its limited financial resources into
areas that will maintain or improve its performance. The adoption of innovative process
technologies in the manufacture of lumber and plywood is one area that always competes for
resources. Adoption's impact on a firm's performance has never been studied. This paper
looks at the importance of adopting innovative processing technologies on a firm's
performance by grouping firms producing softwood lumber and plywood using a hierarchical
clustering technique and then profiling these firms using descriptive statistics. This
technique, using firm controllable strategic variables as clustering criteria, is rarely
used in the forest products industry. Thirty-eight firms, responsible for over 30% of 1987
North American softwood lumber production and over 70% of softwood plywood production,
provided empirical evidence that increased adoption of innovative processing technologies
was linked to superior performance. Companies with high levels of adoption were gaining
market share. Firms with low levels of adoption were losing market share. There was no
correlation between firm size and degree of forward vertical integration. Strong support
for building products firms to allocate resources for the development and adoption of new
and innovative processing technologies is one of the strategic implications of this
research. 81

The parent alkali beam and the crossed thermal beams of the K, Rb, Cs and CC14 have been

problem. The two procedures outlined by Evans and Charnes and Kirby for the non-integer

1 part 1. The infauna of Caribbean intertidal and shallow water environments are dominated
by lignacean bivalves. Experiments show that the distribution is due to the great
tolerance of lucinaceans to temperature and salinity fluctuations. Feeding processes are
important. Microbial populations on plant detrital particles which are larger than those
normally accommodated by suspension feeders are present in most shallow water
environments. The Lucinacea can accept and process large detrital particles. Most other
suspension feeding bivalves have food supplies that are not available to them. The species
co-occur frequently but are not correlated with their distributions. The eurytopic species
occur more frequently in a wider range of environments. Reproduced with permission of the

The survival value of different parts of the Redwinged Blackbird was determined by
comparing the factors that affect it in marsh and upland breeding habitats. The hypothesis
that Redwings are being excluded from their optimal niche space is supported by the
results. colony size, breeding density, and synchrony were greater in marsh than upland
habitat. The proportion of active nests that were successful, number of young fledged per
active nest, and number fledged per egg were all measures of nest success. The lower
reproductive success of upland populations was caused by a larger proportion of nest
destruction. The marsh's predation pressure was negatively correlated with the depth of
water beneath the nest, providing an anti-predator barrier that upland populations are
unable to achieve. The swamping effect on local predator populations is a result of the
synchrony and greater density of nesting in the marsh. Growth rates, weight at fledging,
and the number fledged per successful nest were similar in the two habi- tats indicating

																																					Abstract
Redwings in marshes tend to be more active than colonies in upland habitats, but the
duration of their activity is longer in large colonies. The variation in timing is
probably related to the vegetation in the habitat and not the size of the colony. The
Redwings' survival value was reduced due to the presence of a large number of prey in the
colonies studied. In large colonies, the percentage of nests predated was lower. During
the peak of the activity, the percentage of predated nests was lower in most colonies. The
Holling model can be applied to different sized colonies. Colony size is probably limited
by a territorial system that protects adequate resources. Smaller colonies might suffer
less predation, but genetic exchange can be produced with the permission of the copyright

The mean weight at fledging is the same for Redwing nestlings in marsh and upland

percentage of nestlings that die from starvation is the same. The mean number is similar
between habitats. It is suggested that the relative abundance of food is the same for
nestlings in either marshes or uplands, but that a higher absolute abundance of food in
marshes makes large, dense colonies possible. There are obvious differences in the

Increasing sophistication and precision of experimental tests of relativistic gravitation
theories has led to the need for a detailed. The Parametrized Post-Newtonian formalism
treats the post-Newtonian limit of arbitrary metric theories of gravity in terms of nine
metric parameters, whose values vary from theory to theory. The de- tailed definitions and
equations for the formalism are given, as well as the theoretical and experimental founda-
tions of the PPN formalism. According to some metric theories of gravity, a massive, self-
gravitating body's passive gravitational mass should not be equal to its inertial mass,
but should be an anisotropic tensor which depends on the body's self-gravitational energy.
The PPN formalism's theoretical structure is probed by two theorems. They state that a
metric theory of gravity has post-Newtonian integral conser- vation laws if and only if
its nine PPN parameters have values which satisfy a set of seven constraint equations.

TheASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL was published in 1971 The University of Chicago. All rights
belong to the person. It was printed in the U.S.A. The first in a series of theoretical
papers will discuss the experimental foundations of general relativity. The paper reviews,
modifies, and compares two very different theoretical frameworks. The Dicke framework
doesn\'t take into account the nature of gravity or the gross features of the interaction.
The postulates of the Parametrized Post- Neacionian framework are the two tentative
conclusions. Most of the theories of gravity that are compatible with experiment are
covered by the PPN framework. Future papers in this series will develop the PPN framework
in detail, and use it to analyze a variety of relativistic effects that should be visible
in the solar system during the coming decade. Since 1963, a number of discoveries and
observations have forced Astro- physicists to make general relativity a working tool in
their theoretical model building. It would be naive to think that the very astronomical
phenomena in which rela- tivistic gravity is crucial will provide the answer. The local
behavior of matter and magnetic fields are interwoven with the effects of gravity waves.
There is no hope of getting clean tests of the nature of gravity if they are separated.
The astrophysical enterprise uses the laws of gravity as an input and tries to get out in
for- mation about what the matter and fields are doing. The greatest hopes for clean tests
of gravity lie in space and laboratory technology. The National Science Foundation and the
Office of Naval Research supported the project. Theoretical Frameworks for Testing
Relativistic Gravity is the first paper in the series. The papers in this series will tend
to be theoretical and mathematical, with the exception of the present one. ""Relativistic
Gravity in the Solar System"" will be a companion series. It will look at the nature of
various effects and their prospects for detection in the next few decades. My students and
I dedicate this series of papers to Professor S. Chandrasekhar. Professor Chandrasekhar\'s
beautiful and systematic development of post-Newtonian hydrodynamics is an indispensable
foundation for the ""PPN framework"" developed and used in this series of papers.

equivalence principle is violated in Brans-Dicke theory when the two mass differ by a
small isotropic correction. The two results are explained. The work generalizes and agrees
with previous calculations. In Paper I of this series (Thorne and Will 1971), the
theoretical and experimental foundations for metric theories of gravity were described,
and qualitative aspects of the Parametrized Post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism were discussed.
There are postulates that there exists a metric of signature -2 which governs proper
length and proper time measurements, and that the response of stressed matter to gravity
be described by the equation V.T. The covariant derivative with respect to the metric is
V, and the total stress- energy tensor is T. In this paper, a series of metric parameters
will be used to develop the PPN formalism for perfect fluids. The ""Nordtvedt effect"" is a
rela- tivistic gravity problem. The principle of equivalence is violated by theNordtvedt
effect. According to a wide class of metric theories of gravity, different massive bodies
should fall with different accelerations. This means that the body\'s mass is no longer
equal to its weight. If m is the center mass of the body, a is the acceleration of its
center mass, and U is the external (Newtonian) potential, it can be measured by means of a
test. Permission was granted for this reproduced by the copyright owner. Permission is

There is a significant range of frequencies for a representative selection of spherical
earth models. Higher Love modes can be excited to the fundamental mode for both shallow
and deep sources under a variety of circum- stances, and thus higher mode interference is
an important factor to be taken into account in the proper interpretation and analysis of
Love waves. Simple theoretical computations reveal the nature of the effect of mode
contamination on measured phase velocities, and biases in the selection and analysis of
surface wave data make it appear likely that fundamental mode Love waves experiencing
higher mode inter-ference will exhibit high apparent phase velocities. It may not be
necessary to use complex or anisotropic models to explain the observations. The effects of

																																					Abstract
The basic observation of this study is that seismograms written in southern California
from earthquakes within the northern Gulf of California are different from those of most.
There is a visual difference between the Baja sources and the Gulf seismograms. This is
thought to be a source effect, reflecting the relatively small source dimen- sions and low
seismic moments of the Baja earthquakes. In principle, the differences in the seismograms
could be caused by a near-source or propagation path effect, but the similarity in paths
and the large magnitude of the observed difference argue against this explanation. There
are some North Baja sources with large moments and source dimensions that show that
different seismograms are produced by different sources. Preliminary examination of
seismo- grams from events within southern California suggests the same kinds of regional
variations there. The Northern Baja earthquakes have source dimensions at least a factor
of four smaller and seismic moments, an order of magnitude less than events of similar

Polyamine content of P. tinctorius and B. merulioides was not altered by the addition of

																																					Abstract
The Department of Biology Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Blacksburg
is located in Virginia. The most tolerant of copper were Pisolithus tinctorius and
Boletinellus merulioides. Piloderma bicolor was very tolerant. The copper ion was
deposited outside the cell wall in S. pictus and inside the cell wall in P. tintorius. The
results suggest that there may be differences in growth rates observed on copper amended
media. It is likely incorrect to postulate a single mechanism for metal tolerance and
subsequent improvement of host plant growth in such a diverse group of organisms. Key
words are copper, ultrastructure, tolerance, polysaccharides, cell walls and
ectomycorrhizae. The growth of other organisms is severely restricted by the ability of
some fungi to grow at high levels of copper. A number of mechanisms of copper tolerance
can be found in the fungi. The production and deposition of copper oxalate in the
extracellular hyphal sheath of some wood-rotting fungi is one example. There is a
deposition of hydrogen sulfide in the cell wall of S. cereviseae.

There is an effect of copper on the growth of Pinus densiflora. Host growth at both 0 and
15 g/g copper was improved by Suillus pictus. There was no correlation between growth
under metal stress in pure culture and whether the fungus is an early or late stage
colonizer of the host. Mycorrhizal colonization was decreased by copper, but not by
Pisolithus tinctorius and P. bicolor. There was more branching in the presence of metal if
a fungus caused the host to produce branched mycorrhizal short roots. A decrease in copper
lost from mycorrhizal roots when compared to nonmycorrhizal roots was found in all of the
fungi tested. Mycorrhizal colonization increased root and shoot levels, and the increase
was most noticeable at higher copper levels. The percent of vascular tissue in the trees
was decreased by copper. colonization with P. tinctorius caused copper to be in the shoot.
It was likely that both symbionts were responsible for the formation of the mycorrhizal
association. When two fungi were present on the same host, copper altered the ratio of
short root branching patterns. There are different ways in which heavy metal stress
affects ectomycorrhizal fungi. Colonization of tree roots by aycorrhizal partner can
improve the growth of the tree in metal contaminated soil. When grown in high metal media,
Mycorrhizal Betula can incorporate less zinc and nickel into the aboveground parts of the

																																					Abstract
The Department of Biology is at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University
Blacksburg. Although it is associated with Fraxinus americana, it has never been proven to
be mycorrhizal. Pinus densiflora, a non host tree, was in- oculated with cultures of B.
merulioides. Shoot weights were not increased by inoculation. Short roots lacked root
hairs and had an internal structure similar to that of anycorrhizal rootlets. The short
roots were surrounded by a loose weft of hyphae. The root weight and branching were
increased in inoculated seedlings. The culture filtrates from the liquid cultures of B.
merulioides and Pisolithus tinctorius were analyzed. Both fungi produced measureable
quantities of indole-3-acetic acid. The results show that IAA is the compound responsible
for the dichotomization in the short roots of P. densiflora. Key words: Boletinellus
merulioides, Pisolithus tinctorius, IAA, HPLC, and ectomycorrhizae are commonly associated
in nature with members of the Fagus. Boletinellus merulioides is found in the southeastern
United States. Murrill is collected near Fagus americana L. B. meruliodes is a member of

For a firm to remain competitive, it must allocate its limited financial resources into
areas that will maintain or improve its performance. The adoption of innovative process
technologies in the manufacture of lumber and plywood is one area that always competes for

looks at the importance of adopting innovative processing technologies on a firm's
performance by grouping firms producing softwood lumber and plywood using a hierarchical
clustering technique and then profiling these firms using descriptive statistics. This
technique, using firm controllable strategic variables as clustering criteria, is rarely
used in the forest products industry. Thirty-eight firms, responsible for over 30% of 1987
North American softwood lumber production and over 70% of softwood plywood production,
provided empirical evidence that increased adoption of innovative processing technologies
was linked to superior performance. Companies with high levels of adoption were gaining
market share. Firms with low levels of adoption were losing market share. There was no
correlation between firm size and degree of forward vertical integration. Strong support
for building products firms to allocate resources for the development and adoption of new
and innovative processing technologies is one of the strategic implications of this

orientational preferences for reaction and repulsion. The H + MX reactions are described
in a previous chapter, with good agreement for a suitable choice of orientation, and
calculations using this model are compared with reactive scattering data for the H + MX
reactions. The approximate potential energy surface for these reactions is discussed.

The Department of Radiology and Radiation Biology at Colorado State University is located
in Fort Collins, Colorado. A run-off experiment was conducted with a mountain Podzol soil.
PoO2 was applied to the litter layer as a point source from water collection vessels at
the base of a 30 percent slope. The soil's core is what means annual rainfall. There was 6
inches of ice that was melted. The run-off water was collected at the base of the slope at
the bottom of the litter layer. Data from soil cores were used to predict the movement of
PoO2 to a stream. The first 50 cm of the stream is the most polluted part of the water.

An international corporation has several product-market strategies. Minor modifications of
existing products can be moved into new foreign markets. Difficulties of such a move are
to determine which variant should be used in a market and associated optimum transfer or

with j, yj modules. It's difficult to design a module that the requirements are satisfied
at a minimum cost of surplus components. The problem is Minimize x,y i for all i,j Subject
Xisy are positive integers and 'i' dj are constants. There are two parts to the paper. The
difficulties of rounding the continuous solution are described in the first part of the
problem. There are some properties of the constraint set that aid in the solution of the
problem. The two procedures outlined by Evans and Charnes and Kirby for the non-integer
case can't be used to find the integer solution. An integer branch and bound technique has
been shown to be useful in the solution of small problems and has the potential to be used

The survival value of different parts of the Redwinged Blackbird was determined by
comparing the factors that affect it in marsh and upland breeding habitats. The hypothesis
that Redwings are being excluded from their optimal niche space is supported by the
results. colony size, breeding density, and synchrony were greater in marsh than upland
habitat. The proportion of active nests that were successful, number of young fledged per
active nest, and number fledged per egg were all measures of nest success. The lower
reproductive success of upland populations was caused by a larger proportion of nest
destruction. The marsh's predation pressure was negatively correlated with the depth of
water beneath the nest, providing an anti-predator barrier that upland populations are
unable to achieve. The swamping effect on local predator populations is a result of the
synchrony and greater density of nesting in the marsh. Growth rates, weight at fledging,
and the number fledged per successful nest were similar in the two habi- tats indicating

																																					Abstract
Redwings in marshes tend to be more active than colonies in upland habitats, but the
duration of their activity is longer in large colonies. The variation in timing is
probably related to the vegetation in the habitat and not the size of the colony. The
Redwings' survival value was reduced due to the presence of a large number of prey in the
colonies studied. In large colonies, the percentage of nests predated was lower. During
the peak of the activity, the percentage of predated nests was lower in most colonies. The
Holling model can be applied to different sized colonies. Colony size is probably limited
by a territorial system that protects adequate resources. Smaller colonies might suffer

Increasing sophistication and precision of experimental tests of relativistic gravitation
theories has led to the need for a detailed. The Parametrized Post-Newtonian formalism
treats the post-Newtonian limit of arbitrary metric theories of gravity in terms of nine
metric parameters, whose values vary from theory to theory. The de- tailed definitions and
equations for the formalism are given, as well as the theoretical and experimental founda-
tions of the PPN formalism. According to some metric theories of gravity, a massive, self-
gravitating body's passive gravitational mass should not be equal to its inertial mass,
but should be an anisotropic tensor which depends on the body's self-gravitational energy.
The PPN formalism's theoretical structure is probed by two theorems. They state that a
metric theory of gravity has post-Newtonian integral conser- vation laws if and only if
its nine PPN parameters have values which satisfy a set of seven constraint equations.

TheASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL was published in 1971 The University of Chicago. All rights
belong to the person. It was printed in the U.S.A. The first in a series of theoretical
papers will discuss the experimental foundations of general relativity. The paper reviews,
modifies, and compares two very different theoretical frameworks. The Dicke framework
doesn\'t take into account the nature of gravity or the gross features of the interaction.
The postulates of the Parametrized Post- Neacionian framework are the two tentative
conclusions. Most of the theories of gravity that are compatible with experiment are
covered by the PPN framework. Future papers in this series will develop the PPN framework
in detail, and use it to analyze a variety of relativistic effects that should be visible
in the solar system during the coming decade. Since 1963, a number of discoveries and
observations have forced Astro- physicists to make general relativity a working tool in
their theoretical model building. It would be naive to think that the very astronomical
phenomena in which rela- tivistic gravity is crucial will provide the answer. The local
behavior of matter and magnetic fields are interwoven with the effects of gravity waves.
There is no hope of getting clean tests of the nature of gravity if they are separated.
The astrophysical enterprise uses the laws of gravity as an input and tries to get out in
for- mation about what the matter and fields are doing. The greatest hopes for clean tests
of gravity lie in space and laboratory technology. The National Science Foundation and the
Office of Naval Research supported the project. Theoretical Frameworks for Testing
Relativistic Gravity is the first paper in the series. The papers in this series will tend
to be theoretical and mathematical, with the exception of the present one. ""Relativistic
Gravity in the Solar System"" will be a companion series. It will look at the nature of
various effects and their prospects for detection in the next few decades. My students and
I dedicate this series of papers to Professor S. Chandrasekhar. Professor Chandrasekhar\'s
beautiful and systematic development of post-Newtonian hydrodynamics is an indispensable
foundation for the ""PPN framework"" developed and used in this series of papers.

equivalence principle is violated in Brans-Dicke theory when the two mass differ by a
small isotropic correction. The two results are explained. The work generalizes and agrees
with previous calculations. In Paper I of this series (Thorne and Will 1971), the
theoretical and experimental foundations for metric theories of gravity were described,
and qualitative aspects of the Parametrized Post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism were discussed.
There are postulates that there exists a metric of signature -2 which governs proper
length and proper time measurements, and that the response of stressed matter to gravity
be described by the equation V.T. The covariant derivative with respect to the metric is
V, and the total stress- energy tensor is T. In this paper, a series of metric parameters
will be used to develop the PPN formalism for perfect fluids. The ""Nordtvedt effect"" is a
rela- tivistic gravity problem. The principle of equivalence is violated by theNordtvedt
effect. According to a wide class of metric theories of gravity, different massive bodies
should fall with different accelerations. This means that the body\'s mass is no longer
equal to its weight. If m is the center mass of the body, a is the acceleration of its
center mass, and U is the external (Newtonian) potential, it can be measured by means of a
test. Permission was granted for this reproduced by the copyright owner. Permission is

earth models. Higher Love modes can be excited to the fundamental mode for both shallow

contamination on measured phase velocities, and biases in the selection and analysis of
surface wave data make it appear likely that fundamental mode Love waves experiencing
higher mode inter-ference will exhibit high apparent phase velocities. It may not be

The basic observation of this study is that seismograms written in southern California
from earthquakes within the northern Gulf of California are different from those of most.
There is a visual difference between the Baja sources and the Gulf seismograms. This is
thought to be a source effect, reflecting the relatively small source dimen- sions and low
seismic moments of the Baja earthquakes. In principle, the differences in the seismograms
could be caused by a near-source or propagation path effect, but the similarity in paths
and the large magnitude of the observed difference argue against this explanation. There
are some North Baja sources with large moments and source dimensions that show that
different seismograms are produced by different sources. Preliminary examination of
seismo- grams from events within southern California suggests the same kinds of regional
variations there. The Northern Baja earthquakes have source dimensions at least a factor
of four smaller and seismic moments, an order of magnitude less than events of similar

6 months prior to planting, all possible combinations were broadcast. Through the sikth-
leaf stage of development, the growth rate and leaf appearance rate were recorded. At the
sixth leaf stage of development, weights, populations, and heights were determined. For
leaves 7, 8, and 9 the rates were measured. In the year after planting, the percentages of
switchgrass in the herbage were determined. All measure- ments increased in the year of
seeding, according to the data. In the year after planting, yields showed a positive
influence of carbofuran. The 1986 harvest of the 1985 planting had increased yields but no
affect on the 1987 harvest. Limestone had no effect on the year after seeding. Good

A combination of basic polyhedral units can be used to model the physical properties of
silicate minerals. They could be modeled as the sum of polyhedral contributions. The
contribution of H2O-FeO(6)-Fe(OH) has been determined by multiple regression. We can use
the data to estimate the AG and AH, of other silicate minerals from a weighted sum of the
contribution of each oxide and hydroxide component. The method outlined here can be used
to estimate the thermodynamic properties of silicate phases which are too complex or
impure to give reliable calorimetric measurements. The minerals used in the model have
associated average residuals of 0.26% and 0.24%. The average difference between the
measured and predicted values of 0.25 for AG for 18 minerals and 0.22 for 20 minerals is
less than the difference between the measured and predicted values of 0.25 for AG for 20
minerals. 47 is a number.

The technique that we developed to estimate AGP of silicate minerals by summing the
contribution of polyhedral components can be extended to predict the free energy of
formation of silicate minerals at higher temperatures. Multiple linear regression was used
to find the contribution of the Al2O3(4) - Al2O3(6) The gi coefficients from this model
can be used to calculate the enthalpy of one mole of each oxide or hydroxide component at
a higher temperature. Two seperate linear regressions were used to determine gwater. For
21 minerals used in the model, there are differences of 0.20%, 0.20%, and 0.22% at 400,
500, and 600 K. Experimentally measured AGF versus predicted AGF for four, three, and two

The effect of copper on the activity of the tyrannosaurus rex is studied. Two of the
fungi, Pisolithus tinctorius and Boletinellus merulioides, have naturally brown pigmented
hyphae. The hyphae were developed in the presence of copper. The extracellular tyrosinase
produced by S. pictus was 60 g/g copper. The yellow and black hyphae of Piloderma bicolor
and Cenococcum graniforme were unaffected by copper. The activity of P. tinctorius and S.
granulatus decreased when they were grown under copper stress. The reaction mixture was
activated and repressed by the addition of the polyamines putrescine and spermidine. The
Polyamine content of P. tinctorius and B. merulioides was not altered by the addition of
copper. A decrease in the polyamine content may indicate a change in the permeability of
the cells. Key words are copper and polyamines. Copper can be toxic at relatively low
concentrations, but is essential for normal growth and development. The availability of
copper increases when the pH of the growth medium decreases. The mechanisms of tolerate

																																					Abstract
The Department of Biology Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Blacksburg
is located in Virginia. The most tolerant of copper were Pisolithus tinctorius and
Boletinellus merulioides. Piloderma bicolor was very tolerant. The copper ion was
deposited outside the cell wall in S. pictus and inside the cell wall in P. tintorius. The
results suggest that there may be differences in growth rates observed on copper amended
media. It is likely incorrect to postulate a single mechanism for metal tolerance and
subsequent improvement of host plant growth in such a diverse group of organisms. Key
words are copper, ultrastructure, tolerance, polysaccharides, cell walls and
ectomycorrhizae. The growth of other organisms is severely restricted by the ability of
some fungi to grow at high levels of copper. A number of mechanisms of copper tolerance
can be found in the fungi. The production and deposition of copper oxalate in the
extracellular hyphal sheath of some wood-rotting fungi is one example. There is a
deposition of hydrogen sulfide in the cell wall of S. cereviseae.

																																					Abstract
There is an effect of copper on the growth of Pinus densiflora. Host growth at both 0 and
15 g/g copper was improved by Suillus pictus. There was no correlation between growth
under metal stress in pure culture and whether the fungus is an early or late stage
colonizer of the host. Mycorrhizal colonization was decreased by copper, but not by
Pisolithus tinctorius and P. bicolor. There was more branching in the presence of metal if
a fungus caused the host to produce branched mycorrhizal short roots. A decrease in copper
lost from mycorrhizal roots when compared to nonmycorrhizal roots was found in all of the
fungi tested. Mycorrhizal colonization increased root and shoot levels, and the increase
was most noticeable at higher copper levels. The percent of vascular tissue in the trees
was decreased by copper. colonization with P. tinctorius caused copper to be in the shoot.
It was likely that both symbionts were responsible for the formation of the mycorrhizal
association. When two fungi were present on the same host, copper altered the ratio of
short root branching patterns. There are different ways in which heavy metal stress
affects ectomycorrhizal fungi. Colonization of tree roots by aycorrhizal partner can
improve the growth of the tree in metal contaminated soil. When grown in high metal media,
Mycorrhizal Betula can incorporate less zinc and nickel into the aboveground parts of the

																																					Abstract
The Department of Biology is at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University
Blacksburg. Although it is associated with Fraxinus americana, it has never been proven to
be mycorrhizal. Pinus densiflora, a non host tree, was in- oculated with cultures of B.
merulioides. Shoot weights were not increased by inoculation. Short roots lacked root
hairs and had an internal structure similar to that of anycorrhizal rootlets. The short
roots were surrounded by a loose weft of hyphae. The root weight and branching were
increased in inoculated seedlings. The culture filtrates from the liquid cultures of B.
merulioides and Pisolithus tinctorius were analyzed. Both fungi produced measureable
quantities of indole-3-acetic acid. The results show that IAA is the compound responsible
for the dichotomization in the short roots of P. densiflora. Key words: Boletinellus
merulioides, Pisolithus tinctorius, IAA, HPLC, and ectomycorrhizae are commonly associated
in nature with members of the Fagus. Boletinellus merulioides is found in the southeastern

examined were colonized by VA fungi. In 39% of the samples, there were parasites. VA

technologies in the manufacture of lumber and plywood is one area that always competes for

looks at the importance of adopting innovative processing technologies on a firm's
performance by grouping firms producing softwood lumber and plywood using a hierarchical
clustering technique and then profiling these firms using descriptive statistics. This
technique, using firm controllable strategic variables as clustering criteria, is rarely
used in the forest products industry. Thirty-eight firms, responsible for over 30% of 1987
North American softwood lumber production and over 70% of softwood plywood production,
provided empirical evidence that increased adoption of innovative processing technologies
was linked to superior performance. Companies with high levels of adoption were gaining
market share. Firms with low levels of adoption were losing market share. There was no
correlation between firm size and degree of forward vertical integration. Strong support
for building products firms to allocate resources for the development and adoption of new

The parent alkali beam and the crossed thermal beams of the K, Rb, Cs and CC14 have been
measured with respect to the parent alkali beam. The differential cross section is a
function of recoil velocity and cm angle in the center-of-mass coordinate system. The
transformation is carried out directly by selecting a single representative velocity in
each of the parent beams. The other method does not use the c.m. The coefficients
determined by a least-squares fit to the experimental data are represented by a many-term
polynomial in powers of ucose and usine. The cross sections of the two methods agree and

																																					Abstract
A simple coordinate transformation is presented to convert LAB velocity-space coordinates
to their c.m. counterparts. The trans- formation of intensities between the two frames is
reviewed, and these two results are applied to the kinematic problem, obtaining the c.m.
reactive scattering cross section as a function of scattering angle and speed of recoil
from observed data. For an experiment with initial conditions and velo- city analysis of
the product, the simple application of kinematic relations suffices to determine the c.m.
function. The problem becomes more complicated if there is a spread. The simplest way to
proceed in this case is to ignore the spread. A more rigorous method uses the least
squares fitting technique to give a c.m. cross section which reproduces the data after
velocity-averaging. The least squares method is applied to this problem again after a
review of previous analytical schemes. The effects of velocity-averaging on desirability
of various experimental arrangements are discussed. A recently developed method is

The distributions of H and D atoms produced in cross-beam reactions have been measured.
The reaction exoergicity varies from AD 2 17 kcal/mole for H + KF to -4 kcal/mole for H +

correlate with AD or the identity of the halogen. Qr is larger for the Cs reaction than it
is for K and D is larger than it is for H. The shape of the dis-tribution is similar for K
and Cs and for H and D reactions, but the peak is different for the KF and CsF reactions.

The survival value of different parts of the Redwinged Blackbird was determined by
comparing the factors that affect it in marsh and upland breeding habitats. The hypothesis
that Redwings are being excluded from their optimal niche space is supported by the
results. colony size, breeding density, and synchrony were greater in marsh than upland
habitat. The proportion of active nests that were successful, number of young fledged per
active nest, and number fledged per egg were all measures of nest success. The lower
reproductive success of upland populations was caused by a larger proportion of nest
destruction. The marsh's predation pressure was negatively correlated with the depth of
water beneath the nest, providing an anti-predator barrier that upland populations are
unable to achieve. The swamping effect on local predator populations is a result of the
synchrony and greater density of nesting in the marsh. Growth rates, weight at fledging,
and the number fledged per successful nest were similar in the two habi- tats indicating

																																					Abstract
Redwings in marshes tend to be more active than colonies in upland habitats, but the
duration of their activity is longer in large colonies. The variation in timing is
probably related to the vegetation in the habitat and not the size of the colony. The
Redwings' survival value was reduced due to the presence of a large number of prey in the
colonies studied. In large colonies, the percentage of nests predated was lower. During
the peak of the activity, the percentage of predated nests was lower in most colonies. The
Holling model can be applied to different sized colonies. Colony size is probably limited
by a territorial system that protects adequate resources. Smaller colonies might suffer

Increasing sophistication and precision of experimental tests of relativistic gravitation
theories has led to the need for a detailed. The Parametrized Post-Newtonian formalism
treats the post-Newtonian limit of arbitrary metric theories of gravity in terms of nine
metric parameters, whose values vary from theory to theory. The de- tailed definitions and
equations for the formalism are given, as well as the theoretical and experimental founda-
tions of the PPN formalism. According to some metric theories of gravity, a massive, self-
gravitating body's passive gravitational mass should not be equal to its inertial mass,
but should be an anisotropic tensor which depends on the body's self-gravitational energy.
The PPN formalism's theoretical structure is probed by two theorems. They state that a
metric theory of gravity has post-Newtonian integral conser- vation laws if and only if
its nine PPN parameters have values which satisfy a set of seven constraint equations.

TheASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL was published in 1971 The University of Chicago. All rights
belong to the person. It was printed in the U.S.A. The first in a series of theoretical
papers will discuss the experimental foundations of general relativity. The paper reviews,
modifies, and compares two very different theoretical frameworks. The Dicke framework
doesn\'t take into account the nature of gravity or the gross features of the interaction.
The postulates of the Parametrized Post- Neacionian framework are the two tentative
conclusions. Most of the theories of gravity that are compatible with experiment are
covered by the PPN framework. Future papers in this series will develop the PPN framework
in detail, and use it to analyze a variety of relativistic effects that should be visible
in the solar system during the coming decade. Since 1963, a number of discoveries and
observations have forced Astro- physicists to make general relativity a working tool in
their theoretical model building. It would be naive to think that the very astronomical
phenomena in which rela- tivistic gravity is crucial will provide the answer. The local
behavior of matter and magnetic fields are interwoven with the effects of gravity waves.
There is no hope of getting clean tests of the nature of gravity if they are separated.
The astrophysical enterprise uses the laws of gravity as an input and tries to get out in
for- mation about what the matter and fields are doing. The greatest hopes for clean tests
of gravity lie in space and laboratory technology. The National Science Foundation and the
Office of Naval Research supported the project. Theoretical Frameworks for Testing
Relativistic Gravity is the first paper in the series. The papers in this series will tend
to be theoretical and mathematical, with the exception of the present one. ""Relativistic
Gravity in the Solar System"" will be a companion series. It will look at the nature of
various effects and their prospects for detection in the next few decades. My students and

equivalence principle is violated in Brans-Dicke theory when the two mass differ by a

with previous calculations. In Paper I of this series (Thorne and Will 1971), the
theoretical and experimental foundations for metric theories of gravity were described,
and qualitative aspects of the Parametrized Post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism were discussed.
There are postulates that there exists a metric of signature -2 which governs proper
length and proper time measurements, and that the response of stressed matter to gravity
be described by the equation V.T. The covariant derivative with respect to the metric is
V, and the total stress- energy tensor is T. In this paper, a series of metric parameters
will be used to develop the PPN formalism for perfect fluids. The ""Nordtvedt effect"" is a
rela- tivistic gravity problem. The principle of equivalence is violated by theNordtvedt
effect. According to a wide class of metric theories of gravity, different massive bodies
should fall with different accelerations. This means that the body\'s mass is no longer
equal to its weight. If m is the center mass of the body, a is the acceleration of its
center mass, and U is the external (Newtonian) potential, it can be measured by means of a
test. Permission was granted for this reproduced by the copyright owner. Permission is

contamination on measured phase velocities, and biases in the selection and analysis of

higher mode inter-ference will exhibit high apparent phase velocities. It may not be

																																					Abstract
The basic observation of this study is that seismograms written in southern California
from earthquakes within the northern Gulf of California are different from those of most.
There is a visual difference between the Baja sources and the Gulf seismograms. This is
thought to be a source effect, reflecting the relatively small source dimen- sions and low
seismic moments of the Baja earthquakes. In principle, the differences in the seismograms
could be caused by a near-source or propagation path effect, but the similarity in paths
and the large magnitude of the observed difference argue against this explanation. There
are some North Baja sources with large moments and source dimensions that show that
different seismograms are produced by different sources. Preliminary examination of
seismo- grams from events within southern California suggests the same kinds of regional
variations there. The Northern Baja earthquakes have source dimensions at least a factor
of four smaller and seismic moments, an order of magnitude less than events of similar
