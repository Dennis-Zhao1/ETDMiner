and others helped provide a context for study. My thanks go to those at home and at work
who made learning enjoyable. During the years I pursued graduate studies, my husband,
John, consistently showed his support in tangible ways, playing a significant role in
caring for our children. He helped through both important and less defined tasks, such as
listening to discussions on the role of intuition in problem solving and bolstering my
sometimes faltering courage. Each of my children, Christopher, Katherine, and Alan, has
been patient and accepted our deferring individual or family activities until that magic
moment in time. My undertaking was supported by all three of them. I have worked in the
National Professional Development Group for more than half of my graduate career. There is
a balance between work and study.

Planning and practicality, as well as ideas and research, were brought to my job. I am
proud to be a part of a company that not only tolerates learning in the workplace, but
fosters it. I'm thankful to the three people who I reported directly to. Ernest E.
Bartholomew helped me clarify my goals. I was cheered on by Thomas W. Farley. David A.
Wilson provided continuous support throughout the process. He shared helpful suggestions
and reflections from his own experiences as a student and professor. Positive stances
toward workplace learning will need to be the norm, rather than the exception, in a time
where life-long learning will be needed for professional advancement and business
survival. The Climate that has been established in the Professional Development Group is
worthy of emulation.

The thesis is the culmination of four years of work. Many people have made this possible.
Dr. Budak is my adviser. His posi- tive outlook and energetic leadership have been a
constant source of inspiration, and his personal encouragement and guidance have made
these years both stimulating and rewarding. I would also like to thank Drs. R. J. Morgan,
C. W. Wilmsen, J. Hootman, and F. M. Stein - both for serving on my committee and for
their individual consideration in many other matters. Without the early encouragement and
support of Dr. L. M. Maxwell, this work wouldn't have been done. The work was made

The stimulating environment of the Microwave Laboratory was the most important factor in
the success of this re- search. Excellent physical facilities, great human resources, and
a minimum of red tape have been combined in an atmosphere which is warm and relaxed yet
filled with the excitement of discovery. I would like to thank the staff of the laboratory
for their interest and help during this work. If a group in which students leave every two
or three years is to function, there must be some means of preserving and sending results
and techniques. Theoretically, this is the purpose of advisors, lab notebooks, and
reports; but every student in our group knows that the true source of such knowledge is
Mr. B. I would like to thank Ben for his technical assistance. Professor S. E. Harris has
been a constant source of encouragement. He failed to provide a solution or a new
direction when everything looked bleak. It is unnerving to work with someone who produces
ideas three times as fast as I can understand them, and ten times as fast as I can do the
experiments. It has been a pleasure working with Professor R. L. Byer. His optimism
carried us through many difficulties. Permission is required for further reproduction.

Jean-Louis Lassez were helpful with their critical comments in the early days of the model
ofCSP. There are improvements to be made to draft papers onCSP. Robert Elz was a reliable
source of information. I would like to thank Professor Peter Pooie for allowing me to work
in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Melbourne. Employment within
the department on several occasions is acknowledged. The motivation for this thesis was
kindled by two people. First of all, for his belief that UNIX was worthy of study, be that
as an exercise in programming correctness. During his first visit to Australia, Professor
Tony %oare asked computer scientists to provide formal semantics for new Language
constructs. It is with pleasure that I acknowledge my wife, Sue Thomson, who has been
particularly supportive over the last three years and has been the family bread winner for
the last year - Sue also has managed to convince me on two separate occasions that we
should visit that most magnificent of mountain ranges. I have spent four months in this
region with its peaks and people in the last three years so that I can complete this
thesis. I would like to thank Mike Incigneri for her assistance with proof reading.

The idea to write a biography of Thomas Burnet came from the suggestion of Dr. A.C.
Crombie, Trinity College, Oxford. I have extended my research into other fields because of
the lack of sources for further information on Burnet. Professor R.S. Westfall advised me
to consider the influence of Robert Hooke on his peers, and I have realized that the
activities of Hooke may not be ignored even in the development of Earth science. Professor
R.W. Home has supervised most of my research. His weekly supervision is the best a student
could ever hope for. I was able to conduct my research in Britain and Ireland in 1982
because of the financial support I received. I owe a lot of my training as a historian to
Professor Nobuyoshi Kito and the late Professor Kwan Chiyoda. Professor Masao Watanabe,
Niigata University, Professor Shuntaro Ito, Tokyo University, Professor Zenji Suzuki, and
Professor Masakazu Yoshinaka stimulated me to study the history of science. The help of

I. IV. Many individuals and institutions in several countries provided encouragement,
support, and assistance that greatly benefited this study. Field study research was
conducted under the auspices of the National Research Council of Thailand. The assistance
given by Dr. Choompol, deputy secretary-general, and Pranee Srisarakorn is greatly
appreciated. Logistical support and personal encouragement were provided by the Director
of the Institute for Population and Social Research. The advice and friendship offered by
three staff members of the Institute was much appreciated. The Institute clerical staff
spent a lot of time punching and checking survey data. During the period of field site
selection, Dr. Yindee Soopasen and Paiboon Wattanasiritham made great personal efforts to
provide up-country contacts. The discussions I had with them about their village gave me
valuable insights into how I should conduct my study. The eight university students who
worked with me in Baan Tang Chang made many useful contributions to the study. We owe a
lot to the energy and enthusiasm they brought to the task of conducting the surveys. The
research project produced many valuable dis- dussions from which this work has profited. I

The start of my research can be traced back to the origins of this thesis. My parents
supported and encouraged my interest in prehistory. My interest in excavation techniques
developed through participation on a number of excavations, including those of Professor
A. Leroi-Gourhan and Jean-Philippe Rigaud, was influenced by Paul Callow and Jean-Philippe
Rigaud. Professor F. Bordes and Charlie Dortch took me to the ANU. The excellent
facilities and relaxed but lively intellectual atmosphere of the ANU Department of
Prehistory make it a great place to work. I would like to thank my supervisors, Ron
Lampert, Jack Golson, and Jim O Connell. The task of reading and criticising my initial
chaotic drafts was unenviable, but their comments have helped bring this thesis to a more
balanced structure. I have been helped through many a gloomy moment by the enthusiasm of
Rhys Jones. I would like to thank Ken Aplin, Phil Hughes, and Jenny Hope for their help
with specialist studies. John and Geoff are related. My work has made money from
discussions with other people. Mike Morwood read and commented on my first draft while he
was working on his thesis. They helped me in many ways, including arranging a plane for
aerial photography of the Capertee area, and facilitating access to site records and the
like. The results of their excavations in the Blue Mountains were discussed by both Eugene

identified the faunal material and Ouma Sananikone who did the labelling, counting and
weighing of the specimen. I owe the person who typed my initial draft a debt of gratitude
for giving me a same-day typing service and for putting up with my handwriting, which came

production of this thesis is indebted to Win Mumford who turned a seemingly endless stream
of my outline drawings into respectable diagrams. I have learned a lot about the art of

Their contributions have varied; in some cases, they have been of direct assistance in
connection with specific points in the text, but more importantly, some have been
stimulating in a more indirect way, influ- encing my general thinking and helping order my

of urban geography through his explorations. Dr. Allan Pred is in both categories. The
Berkeley community of the University of California and its geography department are

I would like to thank my thesis advisor, Prof. Paul L. Richards. I have been carried
through many discouraging moments by his enthusiasm, faith, and clarity of mind. I learned
about mental physics in his lab. As we built the Fabry-Perot interferometer, I shared the
excitement, joys, and frustration of learning a new field of physics. His determination
was great. My partner is David P. Woody. His calm and patient approach has often saved the

electronics for the balloon. His experience with ballooning, his expertise with
electronics, and his generous nature made our experiment both possible and enjoyable. They
have contributed to computer programming. As they gave of their time and energy, they have

Parkinson's law states that animals expand to fill the ecological space available to them.
The apparent lack of niche specificity and competitive exclusion among Malagasy lemurs
suggests that far more, and more detailed, observations of lemur ecology than are
currently available will be required before vacant niches can be identified. Since the
advent of man on the island, large scale destruction of the natural vegetation has taken
place, which threatens the extinction of the native Malagasy mammals. The study would not
have been possible without the co-operation of many people. Thanks are due to the
following: Dr. Paul Radaody-Ralarosy and ProfessorVincent Massot, Président and Vice-
