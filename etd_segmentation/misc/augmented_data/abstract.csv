The Department of Nuclear Engineering received 3SPECTS OF RADIATION IN WATER by Chih-Ping
Tso on August 11, 1970 in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master
of Science. Attempts to correlate both data from present work and from Bell with theory
led to apparent inadequacies with the theory. The ""Energy Balance Method"" was developed by
Bell. For later comparison with data from another investigator when this reference becomes
available, this method was used. The Energy Balance Method was used to predict nucleation
of alpha particles from Boron at Pressurised Water Reactor conditions. Detailed
consideration of all the energies present was not done for this reactor case. Neil E.

Terry Winograd submitted to the Department of Mathematics on August 24, 1970 in partial
fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. The system answers
questions, executes commands, and accepts information. Semantic information and context
are used to understand discourse. It combines a complete syntactic analysis of each
sentence with a ""heuristic understander"" which uses different kinds of information about a
sentence, other parts of the discourse, and general information about the world in
deciding what the sentence means. The belief is that a computer can\'t deal with language
unless it understands it. A detailed model of the knowledge needed by a simple robot is
given to the program. We can give it instructions to play with toys and give it
information about the scene. The program has a model of its own mentality, as well as
knowing the properties of toy objects. It can remember and carry out its plans. It enters
into a dialog with a person, responding to English sentences with actions and English
replies, and asking for clarification when its programs cannot understand a sentence
through use of context and physical knowledge. In a ""vertical"" system, each part of the
program is constantly communicating with the others. The large bodies of complex knowledge
needed to understand language have been explored. The type of analysis we use is called
Systomic Grammar. It is structured around choices for conveying meaning rather than the
exact form of rules. The linguistic structures are important for interpreting their
meaning. We don\'t use tables of rules or lists of patterns in our representation of
knowledge. We gain the flexibility and power of programming languages while retaining the
regularity and understandability of simpler rule forms by developing special procedural
languages. Each piece of knowledge can be a procedure, and can call on any other piece of
knowledge in the system. Title: Professor of Applied Mathematics.

The paper was submitted to the Department of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering on
January 8, 1970, in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of
Philosophy. Two basic tasks have been considered. The first model to be developed was a
simulation of a cargo transportation interface in which the cargo is to be transported
from a ship moored at the shore to a beach where no port facilities are available.
Transfer vehicles, such as amphibious craft, are used to transfer cargo from a ship to the
shore. The cargo transfer from the ship to the transfer vehicles is accomplished by ship-
based unloading gear. The cargo transfer from the transfer vehicles at the shore is
accomplished by beach-based unloading gear. The solution method that would allow the
analysis of the mathematical model was the second of these. The sol-ution method should
enable the user to gain an insight into the unloading procedure and thence to correctly
derive the optimum use strategies in the ship-to-shore transfer analysis. The method
chosen was that of computer digital simulation, which not only provides the user with the
necessary in- sight, but also allows the user to solve the problem at hand without the
need for the introduction of drastic simplifica- tions into the mathematical model. The
concept of antithetic variance was introduced to enhance the usefulness of our
methodology. The means by which the user may exercise the underlying math- ematical model
the minimum number of times in order to esti- mate the necessary results with a pre-
specified degree of con- fidence. Because digital simulation is the solution method in
almost all congestion problems, it follows that antithetic variance can also be used in
models other than the one in this study. Guidelines for the user have been included, and
the expected usefulness of the concept of antithetic variance in its application to
congestion problems in general is indicated. Professor of Naval Architecture and Marine
Engineering is the title of the thesis supervisor.

The thesis was submitted to the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics in June 1970 in
partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science. The
engineering and economic aspects of gyro insturment production, test, and repair are
investigated using the concept of life-cycle cost. The study can be applied to other types
of gyros and other engineering devices. A digital computer program format is used to
derive the mathematical model. A unique set of basic cost data was obtained and used to
determine the characteristics of the model. The model parameters which show the greatest
life-cycle cost sensitivities are investigated. It is possible that the return in terms of
lower life-cycle costs is greater than the investment. Walter Wrigley is the thesis

2. In order to fulfill the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Science, equilibrium
ionization is achieved in about 20 microseconds behind. Conductivities of the order of 10
mhos/cr are required to get magnetohydrodynamio interaction with reasonable magnetic
fields. This thesis reports on an investigation of oxy-acetylene detonations at 1/10
atmosphere initial pressure, which wereseeded with Potassium Acetylide to obtain the high
conductivity mentioned above. A sedimentation technique was used to determine the
concentration of the aerosol after it was injected into the initial mixture. The measured
conductivities were plotted as a function of the mole per cent of Potassium added and
compared with the re- - sults of thermodynamic equilibrium calculations. Predicted and
measured conductivities have 888-609- 888-609- 888-609- 888-609- 888-609- 888-609- The
absolute values are agreed within a factor of two and the agreement improves with
increasing mole fraction of Potassium. There is some uncertainty in this value, and a
value twice this gave good agreement between theory and experiment. At 3 mole per cent
Potassium, the maximum measured conductivity was 2.7 mho/ cm. The Associate Professor of

Dynamics of the Tankship Industry"" was submitted to the Department of Naval Architecture
and Marine Engineering on May 21, 1960, in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the
degree of Master of Science in Shipping and Shipbuilding Management. The world oil
tankship industry has a history of bad behavior. The purpose of the thesis is to
investigate the nature and causes of quantitative behavior. The basic organizational
relationships and management decisions in the various parts of the industry are what lead
to such behavior. The method of investigation used is industrial dynamics due to the fact
that such behavior is fundamentally dynamic. This method uses descriptive knowledge of the
functions and relationships in the situation to build a mathematical model. Most of the
considered significant interactions and determinants of behavior were covered in the
model. Expectations were included in the decision-making process. The model is based on
certain assumptions and simplified from the real world. The behavior of the model is
reasonable compared to what would be expected in the real world, despite the
simplifications, assump- tions, and omissions. Industrial dynamics is a valid tool for
this investigation and can yield rewarding results. The new tanker ordering decisions are
very important in stimulating the behavior. The decision rules should be revised to
improve the reasonableness of the system. Time didn\'t allow this author to proceed in
this direction past an outline of the next steps. The model presented can serve as a
foundation structure upon which to develop more fully this area of investigation, and as a
guide in such development. It is hoped that more work is done to understand the tankership
market cycles. The Professor of Industrial Management is Jay W. Forrester.

A variable speed device can be made with two reels connected by a tape. The drive reel's
input motion is transmitted through the tape. The relative motions of the tape change as
the reels turn. The output can be changed by a variation of the tape thickness as a
function of its length. The relative matics of the two reels are of major import- ance,
and the outputs were investigated for the cases of (1) constant tape thickness, (2) tape
thickness varied to produce a constant acceleration, and (3) tape thickness varied to
produce a log function. The input was constant. Dynamics were not considered after the

The structure whirls around a rotating spindle in a twisting balloon further downstream.
The twisting of the yarn in this zone was analyzed. The twisting element and the yarn
guide were also computed. A specially constructed model twisting unit was used to verify
the prediction of yarn twist distribution. The twist level developed at the point of yarn
formation affects not only the fiber migration pattern but also the overall efficiency of
the twisting process. The final twist of the yarn was found to be around 60 percent. It is
essential that the fibers are twisted at such a high rate that they can hold up against
the rotating balloon. The twisting of yarn was considered in detail. The method for
predicting yarn breakage is proposed. Secondary effects were considered in addition to the
actions involved in twisting. They include twist variation with ring rail motion, fiber
drafting in the twisting zone, and the changing geometry of the twist triangle. The study
focuses on important yarn structural effects which relate to twisting conditions and it
leads to several suggestions for process improvements which should be considered in
current mill practice.

Results are presented of a study of the probable performance of water surface craft
supported by hydro- foil systems operating in ocean waves and of the effects of all the
factors which are expected to influence the performance. The establishment of conditions
for sudden aeration of the hydrofoil surfaces is imminent and attention is centered on the
rising and pitching motions of the system. Derivation of the equations of motion of a
hydrofoil system is preceded by studies of the lift on a hydrofoil near a free surface and
the effects of ocean waves. The lifting properties and ventilating characteristics of
hydrofoils are affected by their orientation with respect to the free surface, and
theories are developed and correlated with analyses of existing experimental data to give
relations of design and analytical value. The pitching and rising motions of hydrofoil
systems are derived from general equations. There are two types of systems that are
considered: rigid and non-rigid.

Incidence control is being used. When the area of submerged hydrofoils is variable these
equations are found to contain non- linear terms of the same order as the linear terms.
The equations include linearization and reduction to one degree of freedom. The method of
solving the complete equations for variable- area systems by means of a recently-developed
electronic differential analyzer is explained, and the results of approximately 450
solutions are presented with pertinent conclusions. It is of paramount importance to use
the deepest hydrofoils permissible whenever possible, at least as deep as the height of
the largest waves to be traveled. The largest possible ratio of boat length to chord-size
and the smallest ratio of radius of gyration to boat-length should be used. As the speed
of a hydrofoil system increases, its stability is reduced and its susceptibility to
cavitation is increased, so that careful design of the load distribution on the hydrofoils
is of critical importance. Transient performance of a hydrofoil sy stem entering a wave
near its crest is worse than its steady-state performance.

The effects of changing direction of travel and increasing speed are studied for hydrofoil
systems that travel in waves of varying size and steepness. A hydrofoil system designed to
travel in waves with a height less than the running depth of the foils should exhibit good
stability and smooth performance at high speeds. Transient motions of intolerable
character will likely occur in larger waves. Automatic incidence control may be necessary
at higher speeds.

ahead of thecade. The solution for the velocity of stall propagation is that it increases
with the wave length of the stall cell, tending towards a limiting value for very large
stall cells. The wave length of the stall cells depends on the magnitude of the boundary
layer time delay. The theory predicts propagation velocities within 25% over a wide range
of wave lengths for a stationary circular cascade and a rotating row blade which have been
tested. If other parameters are not changed, an increase in wave length is possible.

The degree of Doctor of Science in Mechanical Engineering was partially fulfilled by the
submission of an Elastic-viscous Matorial Poul R. Pasluy. The process of rolling bulk
plestics into sheets is referred to as abstract calendering. This process is used in the
production of linoleum and plastic sheets. There is always a desire to have a piece of
equipment produce the largest amount of product possible. An analytical approach to the
problem is useful. The flow of an elsstic-viscous materinl thet is being studied. The
solution of this problem can be found in the case of a viscous material. The advantage of
the solution is that it can be used to prodict the behavior of elastic-viscous material.
The problem is broken into two parts, the first being the stress-strain rate equation that
can give suitable predictions for simple types of flows while remaining simple enough to
work with. The equation is given below. Sij Sij (I+aJz)ey is the second invariant of the
strein rate. The effect of Beveral parameters is determined by the results of an
approximate solution of the calendering problem. There is a formal solution in the
appendix. This solution shows the effect of elesticity on the calendering of a material.
This solution can be used as a guide in selecting suitable speeds of operation for
calendering when the material to be calendered exhibits elastic behavior. The professor of
mechanical engineering is the thesis supervisor.

A theoretical analysis of the behavior of carbon was presented to the Department of
Metallurgy on May 16, 1955. Predicting behavior in limit- ing cases has been established.
Oxidation experiments in the systems nickel-carbon, nickel-carbon, titanium-carbon, and
manganese-carbon confirmed the theoretical analysis and contributed to the understanding
of oxidation of these systems. The presence of two oxide layers only one of which is
protective was revealed during an auxilliary investigation. The mathematical formula was
found to agree with the experimental data. The oxidation rate is proportional to the
inverse square root of the reaction time, but as the reaction progresses the rate
approaches a constant value and the protective oxide layer approaches a constant
thickness. Carl Wagner and John T.Norton are professors of Metallurgy.

The survey was submitted to the Department of City and Regional Planning on May 23, 1955.
The aim of this thesis is to determine the sources and the content of certain physical
planning principles and to establish what assumptions and other bases these rest on in
order to assess these realistic. The areas of essential agreement and disagreement were
determined by this survey. The whole range of problems, especially of a physical nature,
which characterizes the contemporary urban environment, was a large segment of the
planning material published since 1895. There was a lot of attention given to proposals
for the ideal city. The middle range between the levels of excessive specificity and gene-
rality was the focus of the decision. The proposals regarding the over-all form of the
city, distribution and relationship of use areas within the city, and the place of the
city in the larger region were some of the interrelated areas. In the last sixty years,
the proposals were studied in terms of five categories of city form. The development of
physical principles shows maturity in their response to real and pressing problems. There
has been an unwarranted reliance on simple assertions, preliminary findings or sheer
opinions, as well as unsophisticated ex-cursions into alien disciplines in search of
principles.

An area of agreement was found. There is an underlying assumption in the literature that
there is a relationship between the physical environment and the social and economic life
of the city. The city's physical arrangement leads to a lot of social ills. A city is
composed of a hierarchy of units that can be used to prove social conditions. The city
should have functionally differentiated areas. Circulation is said to have uses other than
simple motion. The degree of independence or dependence units of a city should be decided
on a case by case basis. A variety of findings, sources, and assumptions are shown in the
proposals for optimum pop- ulation per unit of a city. There are many opinions on whether
the total city size should be limited or not. Like population optima, density standards
have social reconstruction bases. The full r ange of form proposals and circulation
schemes have certain advantages and disadvantages. The thesis supervisor is Burnham Kelly.

The thesis was submitted to the Department of Biology on June 6, 1955, in partial
fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. A pattern similar
to the B pattern of the literature but with much more detail was obtained with the
specimen immersed in 70 per cent ethanol. The repeat period was 34.2 A and the spacing
between helix axes was 25.2 A. The A pattern was obtained from DNA that was immersed in 85
per cent alcohol and stretched 55 per cent. The specimen had a repeat period of 32.50 A.
The A to B2 transition was correlated with mechanical and optical studies in the
literature. A 2 fold extension was observed. A model for the B3 form of DNA was created.
The X-ray data is better than the R Crick model. The basic assumptions are still in place.
It was necessary to figure out a new configuration. The two backbone chains are arranged
outside the base pairs with 10 residues per 34 A turn. The centers of all of the atoms of
the base pair are ithin 5.1 A of the axis. Instrunentation, a method for taking the water
of hydration into account, is one of the aids to analysis that was developed. The B3
pattern was derived from the same type of lattice that was obtained from the DNA stained
with acridine orange. A plausible type of structure was derived for the complex and
correlated with the results of com- plexing studies. Denaturation is vastly different.

This study is an attempt to develop from the basic approach of Schussheim more general
theoretical models relating several variables affecting the growth of towns and to treat
their requirements for community facilities and services with more generalized cost data
than has been applied in earlier studies. Density and pattern of growth are treated
explicitly by the models. Industrial and local development are provided by them. Space
requirements for municipal facilities are taken from planning and engineering standards.
The cost data for specific facilities and services are taken from the experience of many
cities and towns, and are developed in the light of theoretical and engineering knowledge.
The attempt is made to distinguish among levels of service provided and to discover
economies or diseconomies of scale in providing various municipal services. Yearly costs
are calculated for several models for key years. The analysis doesn't take into account
the costs of facilities in the center of town which must be expanded because of the more
intensive activity associated with the new growth. The effect on community costs of the
existence of public facilities in the developing area is not treated.

Density has a major effect on costs but its effect is not as great as that of the level of
service. Low density growth costs more than high density growth because of the same
complement and standard of service. Some services can be eliminated without hurting the
town. The costs of low density development drop below the costs of fully serviced medium
density developments if these services are not provided. As the development proceeds, the
cost per capita decreases. There is a thesis supervisor.

Jeffcoat's submission to the Department of Mechanical Engineering on September 30, 1974.
An analytical investigation of the dynamic behavior of two-truck railway vehicles using
steel wheels and steel rails is described. The measures used to assess dynamic performance
are the maximum stable operating speed and the power density of the passenger compartment.
The performance of the suspension is measured by the tracking error. The models are used
to represent the cars and trucks. The planes of the rails depict trucks as rigid. There
are two models for the carbody, a rigid body with a truck at each end, and a mass with no
yaw freedom and a single truck. The latter model is simpler, and is shown to be a useful
approximation to the former in predicting the influence of suspension parameters. There
are further modes of the carbody which can cause instability or reduce ride quality if yaw
freedom is Inclusion of yaw freedom introduces further modes of the carbody which can
cause instability or reduce ride quality if yaw freedom is Inclusion of yaw freedom
introduces further modes of the carbody Vehicles with conventional rigid trucks, having
opposite wheels connectéd by rigid axles, can become unstable even at low speeds. The
effects of suspension on hunting are discussed. The action of the secondary suspension is
supplemented by an automatic controller. Two special cases of the general controller are
examined in detail and both are shown to be capable of improving all three measures of
dynamic performance. The use of rigid trucks with independently rotating wheels is
evaluated and found to be beneficial in improving ride quality and eliminating the cause
of hunting instability. Conventional trucks exhibit less tracking error due to steady
curving at low speeds, but more at high speeds. The Associate Professor of Mechanical

2GRAMMAR FOR VISION was submitted to the Department of Mathematics on May 2, 1975, in
partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. A
mathematical model for the study of human visual perception is the main result. We discuss
how models of visual processes can be physically tested, as well as the relation of this

perception of icons, we describe the main theoretical concept, stability. A detailed
discussion of a collection of photographs illustrates stability. We can define stability
in a mathematical setting. The stability hypothesis has a relation between the
mathematical expression and the underlying intuition of stability. There is a simple
computational tool that can be used to apply the mathematical structures directly to the
study of perception of icons. We point out that our results are consistent with the views
of visual artists, they yield a non-trivial classification of types of visual ambiguity,
account for a large number of standard ""visual illusions"", and reveal how to construct
many more. A new definition of ""grammar"" summarizes our underlying methodological
considerations. The professor of mathematics was the thesis supervisor.

this thesis. Public-private edges are defined in a certain way. The public space is
defined positively by configurations of private edges, at the smallest scale a vocabulary

It is one of the most important elements in steel. The behavior of molten iron has long

The slip-casting method for the manufacture of crucibles from chromic oxide has been fully

furnace. It is possible to get good results by firing a gun. Excess porosity of the ingot

shown a continuous periodic function in which the Fourier series converges uniformly
everywhere but the Fourier series for the square of the function differs at an everywhere

The importance of sample preparation is shown. In order to decipher their effectiveness as
pressure sensitive adhesives, surface and bulk physical characterization studies of a
series of radial styrene and isoprene based block copolymers were conducted. The materials
were based on p-tert-butylstyrene and isoprene. It was an excellent model system to study
in terms of microphase separation-property response. The most microphase intermixed of the
three systems were the polymers based on p-tert-butylstyrene and isoprene. In two separate
preparations, the three block copolymers were synthesised in a way which yielded either
100% radial (star) blocks or 20% diblock copolymer. The p-tert-butylstyrene and isoprene

There is a p-tert-butylstyrene. A reasonably compatible pair of component blocks were
converted into a system likely to have a higher degree of microphase separation. The
variation of the trade-off between tack and holding power is necessary for PSAs. Holding
power was partially derived from the light crosslinked structure in the isoprene phase, as
well as the development of microphase separation. Each material's compliance was related
to tack. The overall compatibility of the component blocks affected by the chemistry of
the respective blocks as well as the choice of casting solvent was related to the pressure
sensitive adhesive properties of the polymers. The presence of residual diblock material
was found to be an important factor.

There is a break in the lap shear joints. The films of similar triblock materials used in
the study had different free film storage moduli. According to recent theories, there is
partial mixing in the interfacial region between the two incompatible phases of
polystyrene-polydiene block copolymers. The interface thickness is determined by the
temperature. Intermixing of the two phases increases at the expense of the pure phases,
but the copolymers remain phase separated. The two phase structure of styrene-butadiene
block copolymers remains nearly 180C. At a critical temperature, complete mixing of both
phases occurs. The rheological properties of block copolymers are due to the existence of
microphase separated morphologies in the melt. As a function of casting solvent,
temperature, and shear history, the time dependent stress growth and relaxation behavior
of the SBS systems has been studied by Sivashinsky, Moon, and Soong. They wanted to
provide insight into the mechanism of structure breakdown. The underlying principal is 44.

Their investigation showed that the rheology of SBS triblock copolymers is very sensitive.
Many factors, such as casting solvent, temperature, shear history, and overall sample
history, were found to be highly sensitive to the morphology of the SBS systems. It may be
difficult to reproduce rheological measurements. In studies of the stress relaxation
behavior, the fluid's appearance changes with time. Their observations are confirmed by
rhology work in our laboratories. Variable morphologies may exist in almost identically
prepared joints since molten adhesives of the microphase separated type flow into bonding
positions and rapidly cool. J. M. Widmaier and G. C. Meyer have previously shown that only
SIS copolymers with a segregation structure exhibit shear strength. On an increase in
temperature, the joint strength passed through a maximum. The behavior was thought to be
dependent on the copolymers' morphology. The maximum is the temperature at which the
sample is favorable for strong bonding. Different cooling conditions result in bonds of
differing lap shear strengths.

In our laboratory, we have found that the presence or lack of pressure upon cooling of a
bonded joint produces structures which exhibit different dynamic mechanical damping
patterns. The history of the glue was very important in determining its behavior. The
background in this area is important. The topic of densified glasses has been a topic for
the past decade. There are three types of properties that can be measured in the
literature regarding densified glasses. Depending on whether the formation pressure is
above or below 1.5 kbar, there are two different effects. All three of the above
properties decrease with pressure, which is indicative of more efficient packing. There is
an increase in enthalpy and a decrease in specific volume for pressures greater than 1.5
kbar. The glass prepared under elevated pressure contains chains of higher conformtional
46 because of the increase in enthalpy at elevated pressures.

Nitrogen Heterocycles were specifically investigated. The changes in trace element
concentrations were determined by Inductively Conducted Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-
AES) and Size Exclusion Chromatography/ICP-AES. Nitrogen mass balance determinations were
used to examine the fates of basic nitrogen components in residuum products. The expected
dependency of liquefaction on coal rank was demonstrated by the conversion to soluble
products. The western subbituminous coals were very sensitive to drying and solvent-
soaking. There are metals in the liquefaction process. The higher conversions to toluene-
soluble materials were obtained with THQ. The non-distillate product stream had
significant adduction of THQ. The on-line, post-column extraction of Reversed Phase HPLC

The Cone Penetration Test was developed in Holland in the 1930's. The thrust required to
push a cone point through the ground was the only measurement early on. Over the past 20
years, the cone was standardized to a tip area of 10 cm2, and an electrical version was
produced, which allows for continuous measurement of the cone tip resistance and sleeve
friction along with a computer based data acquisition system. The electical cone provides
a contiuous profile of information that can be used to identify soil type and define
important engineering parameters. It has shown potential for calculation of settlements of
footings on sand, determination of pile capacity, assessment of ground pressures, and
evaluation of liquefaction potential for cohesionless soils. There are new varieties of
cone penetrometers with different sizes than the standard. Larger cones have been
developed for pene- trating dense and gravelly soils, and smaller cones are used for
instances where rela- tively small depths of soil need to be penetrated. With the
introduction of the new cones, there has been a tendency to assume that the methods for
reducing the data for the standard sized cone can be applied to the other sizes of cones.
It is assumed that there are no scale effects in cones of different sizes. To date, little
direct evidence has been produced to support this view, and the issue is an important one
from two points of view.

1. Data analysis technology is based on testing with a standard cone. It is important to
know if any changes are needed in this approach, or if the existing methods can be used
with confidence for any size cone. 2. If there is no scale factor, then the use of new,
smaller cones in experimentation in modern calibration chambers will be possible, with the
knowledge that the test results are applicable for the cones that are more widely used in
practice. The smaller cone offers advantages in this type of work in that they facilitate
the research considerably by re- ducing the effort involved in sample preparation, and
they are less likely to produce results influenced by boundary conditions in the chamber.
To develop an insight into the issue of the scale factor caused by the use of different
sizes of cones is one of the major objectives of this research. The program was conducted
in a new large scale calibration chamber at Virginia Tech. Calibration chambers where a
soil mass can be placed to a controlled density under known stress conditions are some of
the latest developments in cone penetration testing. It was necessary to design,
fabricate, and bring to an operational stage a calibration chamber to conduct the
experimentation of this work. One of the largest chambers in the world is in Virginia
Tech. The majority of the effort involved in this thesis research was devoted to this
task. The implementation of a microcom- puter based data acquisition unit to record and
process the test results was the focus of attention. Three different sizes of cone
penetrometers were used in a test program to investigate scale effects. The standard cone
has a tip area of 15 cm2, the standard cone has a tip area of 10 cm2, and the standard
cone has a tip area of 4.23 cm2. A total of 47 tests were carried out in the chamber using
two different densities of sand. The test results show that a scale factor might exist,
but it doesn't seem to have much of an effect on interpreted soil tests.

Mickey E. Gunter F. Donald Bloss is the Chairman of the Geological Sciences. If a polished
surface of sufficient size exists, the simplest, most rapid, and precise method to
determine the Refractive index is by total reflection. It is more precise than routine oil
immersion techniques but less precise than minimum deviation methods. Minimum deviation
requires large crystals and specifically oriented prisms, as well as triclinic crystals,
for each wavelength of measurement. Only after a complete understanding of the phenomenon
of light reflection from randomly oriented anisotropic materials can the RTR method be
automated. The mathematics and physics required for this come from theories and equations
in the literature. These were modified, rewritten, and unified to fit the requirements of
RTR. The first use of RTR was by Wollaston (1802a, 1802b) for the measurement of the
Refractive index and orientation of biaxial minerals in thin section. Refractive index to
a pre-cision of 0.0002 was achieved by RTR with the Abbe-Pulfrich refractometer. The
jeweler's refractometer was introduced by Smith in 1905b and had a precision of 0.001 to
+0.002. This is what it is.

biaxial mineral in a thin section. For triclinic crystals, a single polished surface will
suffice for measurement of the three principal Refractive indices. The design and testing
of the refractometer took three years. Two prototypes were built and tested. The results

There are Impatiens populations. Both species had higher nectar volumes with lower solute
concentrations in the morning, but both species had higher production rates in the
afternoon. Environmental factors affecting population sites were associated with
differences in nectar volumes. The ability to produce cleistogamous flowers and their
subsequent offspring ensures sexual reproduction, and capensis avoids competition by
relying on hummingbirds and insects other than bumblebees. Inbred offspring of I. capensis
are better than outcrossed stock. Despite the absence of bumblebee pollination and the

The model for the onSET of EDGE-EFFECT at HOLES in COMPOSITE LAMINATES was written by K.
L. Reifsnider. The mismatch at the edge is analysed in a linear way. There is a phenomenon
that occurs in a boundary layer. The ""Boundary Layer Effect"" is referred to in the
literature as the ""Edge Effect"". It is important to be able to predict delamination
locations at edges prone to such events. The goal of the research was to create a model
that could give a prediction. In order to generalize the model, the more complicated case
of a free edge at holes was chosen instead of the straight free edge. The development of
the analysis of the free-edge effect at a hole was the second of three major efforts.

The model was established and compared with the experimental results. The order of the
singularity and strain energy release rate are two major products of the analysis. The
interface most prone to delaminate is located at the point along the hole circumference.
There are two material systems and two stacking sequences. After each loading stage, the
specimen was X-rayed to locate the start of delaminations. It was an excellent opportunity
to examine the performance of the matrix and its influence on the process of delamination
due to the fact that both materials consisted of the same type of fibers. Experiments and
the prediction model were used to examine matrix dependent behavior. There was good
correlation and high sensitivity to the type of matrix material involved.

Ronald L. Hall is the Chairman of the committee that wrote a study about PEER COACHING and
TEACHERS in a large Virginia public school system. Allowing teachers the chance to build
relationships is one way to bring about a restructuring. Peer coaching can be used to
allow for the restructuring of schools in order to create a more professional working
environment in which teachers work and learn together, according to advocates of peer
coaching. The restructuring should allow for more resources sharing among the teachers by
creating a working environment of trust. Better teaching should result from teachers'
levels of job satisfaction increasing. There is no empirical support for this claim.
Information about the implications of building such relationships on the profession of
teaching and the working environment of the school is needed by administrators who are
interested in restructuring schools.

usefulness of peer coaching, as well as their perceptions about the degree to which trust
and sharing of resources existed in their schools. The data collected from the
questionnaire was entered into a computer using the Statistical Package for the Social
Sciences. To determine the extent of differences between elementary, middle, and high
school teachers on the selected variables, an analysis of variance was used. The teachers
agreed that peer coaching was useful and that they trusted each other. Their participation
in resources sharing was less frequent. They were happy with their teaching jobs. The
variables were positively and moderately correlated except for a weak correlation between
resources sharing and job satisfaction. This meant that on the whole.

Teachers who found peer coaching were more satisfied with their jobs and felt more trust
and resources sharing. There were no differences in the usefulness of peer coaching or job
satisfaction among the three levels of teachers. All levels had differing levels of trust
in their school. Elementary teachers shared more resources than middle school teachers.
Peer coaching seems to have given teachers the opportunity to learn about their teaching
on the job, as well as reduced isolation among the teachers. Further training in feedback
skills and group process skills along with more opportunities to observe one another are
recommended as ways to further reduce isolation and create conditions in which teachers
are more able to solve problems.

An analysis of correlated curve trend experiments in Eucalyptus grandis was done by Brian
Victor Bredenkamp. The growth parameters were described as functions of age using
Schnute's growth function. Growth attributes were used to describe a diameter distribution
model for the species. The relationships between growth parameters and stand density were
scrutinized with multiple comparisons. Under extreme suppression, di- ameter growth in
lower size classes ceases, while larger size classes continue to grow, resulting in
greater dispersion in diameter. Competition mortality was limited to the lower size
classes and severe mortality results in an apparent increase in mean diameter which
precludes use of growth functions. There were two different sites where allometric growth
was investigated. This allows a ratio approach to the estimation of growth and yield on
one site. Thinning effects in terms of diameter and height changes were estimated using
data from unthinned stands while the results of long-term thinning studies were compared
in terms of cumulative volume yields. A model for the estimation of m.a.i. as a function
of age and stand density was constructed. The slopes of the spacing in- dices were much
more steep than for other species. The age of the better-known indices was determined.

Cynthia A. Arnold James E. McGrath is the Committee Chairperson of the Department of

their excellent thermal and mechanical properties, but their typical intractability in the
fully imidized state has been a serious limitiation. Several methods by which the
processability of polyimide systems may be improved are the focus of this research. One
method involved using a solution imidization technique to convert the poly(amic acid)
intermediate to the fully cyclized polyimide. The use of monofunctional reagents to obtain
controlled end groups and weights was an important method. Modifications achieved by
either polydimethylsiloxane or polyaryl ether sulfones or ketones, or variation of the
dianhydrides or diamines resulted in major strides in obtaining enhanced processability.
Significant reductions in the dielectric constant and water sorption were obtained by
incorporating relatively nonpolar reactants.

The poly(aryl ether imide) segments showed high glass transition values, excellent
toughness, and remarkable solution processability. Depending on the imide component's
polarity, a two phase morphology can be obtained. The thermal behavior of the
poly(siloxane imide) segments was dependent on a number of factors. Microphase separation
was achieved at a relatively lowmolecular weight for a copolymer system. The more phase
mixed morphology was determined by the thermal analysis of the imide component. The BTDA
and m-DDS based systems behaved like modified polyimides at lowsiloxane levels. The
copolymers were similar to thermopolastic elastomers. Polydimethylsiloxane has a number of
benefits, including enhanced solubility, reduced water sorption, good thermal and
ultraviolet stability, resistance to degradation in aggressive oxygen environments,
flammability resistance, improved impact resistance, and modified surface properties. One
way to take advantage of the benefits of siloxane inclusion was to use poly(siloxane
imide) segments as blend components with other high performance engineering polymers. Most
of the blend systems were investigated. Polyimides based on BTDA and m-DDS were not
miscible. 6F dianhydride and m- or p-DDS were used in blends of PBI with polyimides. Due
to a conversion of the siloxane component to a stable silicate-like structure,
Poly(siloxane imide) segments and blends exhibited excellent stability to high energy,
high flux atomic oxygen.

Supported Aqueous Phase Catalysts is a novel family of catalysts. These catalysts consist
of a water-soluble organometallic complex supported in a thin film of water residing on a
high surface area hydrophilic solid; the reaction takes place at the water-organic
interface where the organic contains the reactants and products. Liquid phase
hydroformylation is a novel type of catalysis. The support is a porous glass with a narrow

impregnated after it was dissolved in water. The hydroformylation of OLH was done at 100C

The hydroformylation of additional OLOH and the hydrogenation of added 1-hexene was
attempted, but there was no evidence of a leaching of Rh. The absence of conversion
indicated that Rh was not put into the organic phase. The concept of SAPC, which is to
perform catalysis at an interface, is proven because OLOH is not watersoluble, the double
bond is internal, and the Rh does not migrate into the organic phase.

The case study addressed the question, ""What strategies and tactics do people use?"" Such
problems are not solved by applying well-known procedures or decision rules. There was a
lack of empirical data on accessing intuition during problem solving. There were no
studies linking ill-structured problems and intuitions. The study looked at people\'s
specific actions when an overall solution becomes apparent. It focused on both the
conscious actions people take to access their intuition and on the conscious or
unconscious skills, clusters of related skills, or procedures they use. Human resource
managers were in attendance. The group was chosen because its members often encounter
complex problems or help others.

How to solve these problems should be the focus. Some people were recommended by their
colleagues to be interested in intuition. They completed journals to record the moment of
solution and participated in follow up interviews. The role of ""co-researchers"" was played

interviews to make sure their statements were understood. Two peopleborated on the process
of category construction. A qualitative content analysis of journal results indicated that
in seven instances intuitions occurred when participants were with others and that these
seven were listening in some fashion at the moment of solution. According to the analysis,
actions most frequently taken at the moment of intuition included searching, thinking-
working on task, undirected thinking, making connections, and listening. Whether a given
action was a strategy, tactic, or tacit process depended on how deliberately people acted
and how aware they were of their actions. The results showed that problems were poorly
structured and that intuitions had the same characteristics as those identified by

for the constant condition and 4.84 Kcal/mole for the cyclic condition. The effect of
stress may be reduced. The creep behavior was dependent on the amount of stress. The fiber
elastic compliance increased. The correlation between the fiber elastic compliance and the
creep rates was found. The hydrogen bonds between the crystallites are small and relative

The growth of Fe3O4 and FeOOH crystals was studied. Growth Modifiers were used to change
the formation of iron oxides. The influence of multifunctional carboxylic acids was found
to be strong. The characteristics of a-FeOOH were changed by dicarboxylic acids.
Alteration of the isoelectic point of the particulates was one of the changes. The
synthesis of -FeOOH over a-FeOOH was favored by EDTA at temperatures below 50C. The
interaction between the acid molecule and Green Rust II is believed to have caused the
changes in FeOOH formation. The growth of Fe3O4 was found to be sensitive to a number of
factors. Other phases formed prior to the production of Fe3O4. Depending on the amount of
hydroxide in the reaction and the starting materials, there were different intermediate
phases. Early precipitation of Fe3O4 led to small particles, while the formation of
crystalline Fe(OH)2 led to large crystals. The formation of a mixture of Green Rust Il and
Fe(OH)2 early in the oxidation process led to the formation of multiple nuclei, and
produced smaller average particles with a wide particle size distribution. Fe3O4 particles

A new approximate method based on the Galerkin method has been developed to overcome the
mathematical difficulties associated with the solution of instability problems. This

injector face and the combustion process is distributed throughout the chamber. The hot
combustion products are assumed to leave the combustion chamber through a quasi-steady
nozzle, using Crocco's time-lag (n, T) hypothesis. In a second order analysis the steady
state Mach number is assumed to be small and the conserved equations are combined to get a
single partial differential equation which describes the behavior of the velocity
potential. A series of acoustic modes are used to expand the velocity potential. A system
of ordinary differential equations can be solved using this series. The final amplitude in

The temporal properties of inhibition have been overlooked in favor of steady-state
conditions, even though they have been suggested to account for many visual phenomena.
There are some experiments that show the importance of excitatory and inhibitory
Transients. Transient responses are thought to be active in temporal phenomena of human
vision. To determine the role played by Transient inhibition in masking and metacontrast,
increment thresholds were needed. Since the effectiveness of a brief test flash is a
measure of the magnitude of the inhibitory Transient at various points in its time course,
the visual masking functions constructed from the threshold data represented an indirect
picture of the temporal course of lateral inhibition. The results showed that increasing
the illuminance of the masking annulus increased the magnitude and decreased the peak of
the masking functions. When the masking flash was increased by three log units, the peak
masking effect for three observers shifted from test flashes to the mask. The results of
the masking functions were compared with other visual masking theories. Permission was

welfare economic aspects of financing medical care are examined in my thesis. There is no
one role for government that is independent of citizens' values. There is a strong case
for laissez-faire. The technological externalities generated by personal health care are
minor and redistribution in kind is inefficient. I don't think the latter assumption is
valid. The inefficiency of in kind redistribution is based on the idea that the potential
beneficiary could do better if he were given the cash equivalent. The potential tax-
payer's preferences are not taken into account. James Buchanan has explicitly challenged
the second in my thesis.

Mark Pauly and C. M. Lindsay have challenged it with their work on efficiency in financing
medical care. The men have included tax- payer preferences in their analysis, but they
have left out beneficiary preferences. Any combination of taxpayer and beneficiary
preferences can be analyzed. The traditional case against redistribution in kind as well
as the work of Buchanan, Pauly and Lindsay are very special cases because of their
assumptions about pre- ferences of potential taxpayers and beneficiaries. The reader can
decide how appealing or accurate the former is. I show that the distribution of income is
the most important factor in determining the role of government. I examine the most
efficient methods of subsidizing medical care in order to achieve alternative policy
goals, as well as establishing that subsidizing personal health care expenditures may be
efficient. I show that a vanishing tax credit for health services would be a more
efficient method of assuring that all individuals consumed at least some minimum amount of
care than a tax credit for health insurance. The latter might be more efficient in
achieving equal access to health care.

quality levels at various points in the system and transition matrices to describe the

systems. The design of systems for specified quality objectives, the selection of the
optimal means of producing the same output, and the establishment of quality oriteria are
some of the applications of this analysis. The models can be used to predict the effects

In 1949, the first observations of Spatial ""intermittency"" in the velocity field fine-
structure of fully turbulent flow regions were made. This phenomenon is studied further
here, in particular in grid-generated, nearly isotropic turbulence and on the axis of a
round jet. The small eddies concentrate in ran- dom domain, occupying a fairly small
fraction of the fluid volume. The turbulent patterns are convected past the hot wire by
the mean flow as the hot-wire anemometer signals appear intermittent. As the Reynolds
number increases or the size of the eddies decreases, the fine- structure volume
decreases. The size of the eddies with which these fine-structure regions are active is
larger than the average linear dimensions of these fine-structure regions. The relative
dimensions decrease with increasing Reynolds number. To study the statistical geometry of
the fine- structure regions, two-probe coincidence functions for the occur- rence of fine-
structure were measured. Depending on whether the three mean dimensions of the domain are
all of the same order, three possible categories of geometry were considered.

second Rx 0.25 derivative, one for Rx  100 and one for Rx 0.75. The absolute constant
values at high Reynolds number were not observed at Rx up to one thousand. The small-scale

They are not. As we look at smaller and smaller scales from the complete signal, the
deviation from normal increases. The flatness factor of the band-pass signal increases
with incroasing and decreases with noise. The flatness factor of a band-pass sig- nal is
dominated by the filter's smoothing effect if the bandwidth is very narrow. The band-pass
signal is normal in the limit of infinitely narrow bandwidth. The square of the signal
associated with large wave numbers can be approximated by a log-normal probability
distribution.

An analytical procedure using linear strain finite elements and special frame elements has
been developed. The tielinks connect the shear panels to the frame so that cracking can be
included at the panel boundaries. The plane stress elements are required to have
anisotropy under a general stress field. The method uses anisotropy for describing cracked
elements, but assumes the uncracked elements are isotropic. Material relations are not
altered for the stress state. A set of test examples and frame-and-panel models are
analyzed using this method. When possible, predictions of cracking, stress patterns, and
deformations are compared to experimental re- sults. A.C. Scordelis is the Chairman of the

The mechanism of the bromodemetallatior of organotin compounds has been investigated. The
stereochemistry of the reaction of trialkyltin compounds and bromine has been done. The
bromodemetallation of trineopentyl-sec-butyltin proceeds with the inversion of

The bromodemetallation of lineopentyl-sec-butyltin bromide was found to proceed with at

The rate of bromodemetallation was carried out. The investigation was expected to give a
detailed knowledge of the charges present in the transition state of bromodemetallation.
An unusual rate sequence was observed. The bromodemetallation of the more reactive
derivatives proceeds via an attack by bromine on the aromatic nucleus of the benzylic
group. A change in mechanism is suggested to account for the rates of reaction of the less
reactive derivatives. Evidence shows that the bromodemetallation of compounds proceeds

The distribution of gas satisfying the equi- librium and Poisson conditions is derived and
compared with the observations of the gas density at the galactic tangential points. There
are simple one-dimensional equipartition magnetic and Cosmic-ray components in the gas
equilibrium equation. The total mass density at the galactic plane is equal to the sum of
the observed gas and star densities in the solar neighborhood. The Z component of the
turbulent gas velocity in the solar neighborhood is established using recently observed
values for the magnetic and Cosmic-ray pressures. The half-thickness of the equilibrium
disk of galactic gas is derived from a theoretical expression. The half-thickness is
proportional to Q, where Q2 equals the square of the 2 Z component of the turbulent gas

The usual interpolatory methods such as theNewton-Raphson and Secant are included in the

infinite precision. A condition has been added to the definition of rate to make sure
thatEncoding does not improve the rate. The class of optimal algorithms is obtained using

There is an investigation of several aspects of the control structure of programming

to develop a programming language with a control extension facility. This language has a

operations for sequential processing, parallel processing, alternative selection,

The control description language is used to give formal descriptions of itself, the
simulation language Sol, and a variety of control structures. A number of nonstandard
control structures, including a nondeterministic control called sidetracking, are invented
to further illustrate the thesis. The use of nonstandard controls leads to efficient
implementations. The sidetrack control is used in the most extensive example. It is
refined by the use of appropriate control structures, beginning with a simple breadth
first search recognition process. Minor additions are made to allow translation and error

The volume change character istics of saturated clay are studied in this thesis. The study
looked at the mechanical behavior of a clay particle system. The mechanical behavior is
thought to be governed by repulsive and attractive forces among the particles. The
repulsive forces in the clay-water system are caused by the interaction of the double
layers on the surfaces of the particles. Interparticle spacings in natural soils and man-
made soil deposits which have engineering importance are rela- tively large. Double layer
theory states that repulsive forces can be adequately expressed. The attractive forces
between clay particles have been attributed to van der Waals's forces. The objective of
the analysis is to determine the repulsive forces among the particles, under various
distortions of the model unit, in order to describe the volume change-force relationship
for the model unit structure. The value of the analysis is confirmed by comparing the
resulting volume change-force relation- ships to those obtained from experimental results.
The forces in the double layer can be found from a force-field potential, and the
distribution of potential is given by the funda- mental equation of the double layer.
Closed form solutions can't be obtained with the exception of a few specialized cases.

The purpose of this study is to add another aspect to the existing interpretations of what
caused the United States to turn its back on its enemies. The first national debate on
overseas expansion was sparked by the question of annexing the Hawaiian Islands. It lasted
for five years. In the midst of the Spanish- American War, the Senate passed a resolution
annexing the Hawaiian Islands to the United States. The political action inaugurated a
foreign policy that would lead to an empire in less than a year. Historians have debated
why the United States suddenly abandoned its anti-colonial stance. The Congressional
resolution for war with Spain in 1898 seemed to strengthen the anti-colonial tradition.

The same body agreed to annex the Hawaiian Islands. Studies of late nineteenth century
American expansion have concluded that the political decision for this departure in
foreign policy reflected a favorable ex- pansionist sentiment within the nation. Some
studies have described it as mass sentiment while others have referred to it as a growing
sentiment during the 1890's without defining the extent of change. The interpretations
suggest that the politicians received a measurement of the popular sentiment for expansion
and that it influenced their votes on the annexation issue. Interpretations fail to reveal
the complicated nature of popular opinion. They don't say what part of the American public
held opinion on expansion, or how popular opinion was communicated to the politicians, or
what extent popular expansionist opinion influenced the politician's vote on Hawaiian
annexation. Measuring devices of public opinion were not used in the 1890's. There is no

It was possible in the 1890's. According to the findings of the study, popular opinion may
have been more in favor of Hawaiian annexation in 1898 than it was in 1893. The evidence
shows that if a measurable change in public sentiment did occur during the 1890's, it
occurred in small, sharply defined segments of the population. Being numerically small and
divided along party lines was not effective in influencing political decisions on foreign
policy. Expansionist sentiment may have influenced the final action for annexing Hawaii,
but it was not the most important cause. The evidence shows that the major political
parties took opposite sides on the issue and that the action was aided by the Spanish-

The purpose of the study is to clarify Andrew Johnson's reasons for vetoing the first
reconstruction act. Historical explanations of the veto have been limited to Johnson's
attitude towards Congressional Reconstruction. February and March 1867 were some of the
most important months in American history. The First Reconstruction Act provided a
procedure for restoring the ex-Confederate states to the Union. The Civil Rights Act and
the Freedmen's Bureau Bill were both vetoed by Johnson. He was expected to veto the First
Reconstruction Act. Many leaders of the Republican Party put pressure on Johnson to
approve the legislation because of a new Congress dominated by Radicals. Andrew Johnson
was not intimidated by the situation. The bill was vetoed on March 2, 1867. Andrew
Johnson's role during Reconstruction has been evaluated differently by American
historians. In spite of the differences, they can be classified into three groups.
Historians writing before 1900 had the same aim of justifying a sectional point of view.
They looked at the period and evaluated Johnson. James F. Rhodes and Ellis P. Oberholtzer
were the most prominent. Rhodes believed in Johnson.

stubbornness and unreasoning obstinacy motivated his vetoes. The stereotype of Johnson as
a demagogue was created by Oberholtzer. There was a new interpretation of the
Reconstruction Period between 1898 and 1904. The professor at the University of Columbia
provoked this interpretation through his books and lectures. The evil and corruption of
Northern Republicans' reconstruction policies in the South was presented by his students
and followers. The harm done to the South by these policies was emphasized. The school was
distinguished by its professionalism. It was part of the first generation of historians
who went to original sources and reached conclusions. Their interpretation enjoyed a lot
of prestige. When the so-called revisionists appeared in the 1930's, the interpretation of
the Dunning school was almost unquestioned. The revisionists began to look at the issues
from different points of view. They pointed out the weaknesses of both Johnson and the
Radicals. They began to retell the story of Reconstruction in terms of the economic and
social forces at work in the nation without the preconceptions that limited the earlier
groups. W.E.B. Du Bois, John Hope Franklin, Harvey Wish, and David Donald all died.
Revisionist historians include Vann Woodward, Hodding Carter and James G. Randall.

according to McKitrick. The findings of this etudy show that the previous explanations of
Johnson's veto of the First Reconstruction Act have validity. The explanations need to be
examined in detail to see how they apply to the veto of the First Reconstruction Act. The
Act conflicted with Johnson's belief that order prevailed in the South, violated his
desire for economic retrenchment, and disrupted his pardon policies, among other reasons.
He expected the veto to win him conservative support. The factors that led to Johnson's

Five different methods were used to examine cell contact behavior in normal and hybrid
amphibian embryos in an attempt to understand the role of cell surface adhesiveness in
gastrulation. The results are for each type of embryo. In this normal embryo, prior to
gastrulation, all cells show an increasing tendency to attach to glass substrata. The
rates show marked decreases with age from the blastula to the late gastrula period. The
movements of the explanted germ layer fragments are reminiscent of portions of
gastrulation. From the blastula to the late gastrula period, presumptive ectodermal cells
form cell contacts which become increasingly intimate. There are a lot of close cell
contacts in early gastrulae. The viable hybrid embryo, which occasionally shows
abnormality in invagination, is quite similar to the viable hybrid embryo. Alterations in
cell contact behavior correlate with alterations in gastrulation. The hybrid undergoes a
mental arrest at the start of gastrulation. There is a wrinkling in the roof of the
blastocoel during a short time when controls are undergoing epiboly. There is no
invagination or archenteron form. The animal cells show an increase in attachment. The
rates of disaggregation decrease with age. The movements seen in replanted fragments are
similar to those seen in normal fragment combinations. Presumptive cells have low
attachment frequencies, reduced ability to reaggregate, and no tight junctions. The embryo
undergoes a severe developmental arrest at the start of gastrulation. Any cells have
little or no increase in attachment frequencies. The stages disaggregate quickly. The
fragments show no movement. Presump- tive cells have low attachment frequencies, little
ability to reaggregate, and no tight junctions. The cells do not form intimate contacts at
the level of fine structure. The hybrid undergoes the most severe arrest at the start of
gastrulation. There is no increase in attachment in any cells. Disaggregation rates are
high at all stages. The fragments show no movement. Presumptive cells have low attachment
frequencies, no ability to reaggregate, and no tight junctions. The extent of normal
gastrulation and the extent of increase in cell surface adhesiveness correlate positively.
The morpho- genetic movements of gastrulation require increased cell surface adhesiveness.

The amount of L-asparagine and L-aspartic acid produc- tion by intact cells was
determined. Sensitivity to L-Asparaginase resistant tumors produced less than a small
amount of L-asparagine/mg of cells/hour. The newly synthesized L-aspartic acid was mostly
distributed in the cells, while the newly synthesized L-asparagine was mostly distributed
in the medium. There was no concurrent inhibition of L-aspartic acid production when the
L-asparagine analogs DONV and CONV were used. The purification and characterization of
L-asparaginase from one of the L-asparaginase resis- tant tumors, 6C3HED-RG1, is
described. According to initial studies, L- glutamine interacted with free L-asparagine
and released L-glutamic acid, which caused the aminated and adenylated enzyme to form. The
modified enzyme reacts with L-aspartic acid to release the two drugs. Alteration and
reversibility studies supported the proposed mechanism. Studies with L-asparagine analogs
showed that DONV competed with the L-glutamine or L-asparagine site on the free enzyme,
and that CONV interacted with two or more stable enzyme forms. The Ter-Quad system is a
reaction with three substrates and four products. The mathematical approaches have been

flow, more space is needed above the water-flow area. The water-flow area in the
horizontal conduit is determined by the ratio of the radius of curvature along the
centerline to the bend diameter, I/Df and the deflector thickness at the crown of the
bend. The aeration of the water flow makes it easier to seal the conduit. Waves on the
flow surface speed up seal and delay seal. The ratio of the centerline to the bend
diameter is larger than the original. Permission is required for further reproduction.

The purpose of the research was to study the reaction of hydro- - carbons with atomic
oxygen; the main focus was on product determination and reaction rates. The oxidation of
aromatic compounds with ground state atomic oxygen was the majority of work. The flow
system at atmospheric pressure and 30C was found to be convenient for most aromatic com-
pounds studied, and the mercury photosensitized decomposition of nitrous oxide at 2537A
was the experimental technique of choice. The compounds that were successfully oxidized
were: benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, tert-butylbenzene, ortho, meta-and para-xylene,
mesitylene, 1, 2,3-trimethylbenzene, anisole, fluorobenzene, The main products were
phenols. When ortho-methyl groups were present, the reaction became important. There was
no evidence for formation of anisoles in the case of 1, 2, 3-trimethylbenzene. When

The logarithm of the partial rate factors gave a straight line when plotted against the
ground state electron densities of aromatic hydrocarbons. This was seen as proof of an
early rate-determining transition state in the oxidation of hydrocarbons. The activated
effect of the groups was determined by their position and number. A plot of calcu- lated

The product phenol is not ruled out. Oxidation of aromatics via a microwave glow discharge
through CO2, O2 or N2O gave different product distributions than did the mercury-nitrous
oxide technique. Toluene and para-xylene gave large amounts of side chain oxidation as
well as substantial amounts of methyl cleavage. The side chain in toluene was cleaved to
produce phenol. Attempts were made to determine the side-chain oxidant in the discharge.
The best explanation is that 013p, reacting at a high temper, is responsible for the
observed products. The action of ozone on toluene and cyclohexane received little
attention. The photode- compositions of toluene, nitrobenzene, anisole, chlorobenzene and

A new approximate method based on the Galerkin method has been developed to overcome the
mathematical difficulties associated with the solution of instability problems. This
method is used to study the behavior of combustion driven oscillations in cylindrical
combustion chambers in which the liquid propellants are injected uniformiy across the
injector face and the combustion process is distributed throughout the chamber. The hot
combustion products are assumed to leave the combustion chamber through a quasi-steady
nozzle, using Crocco's time-lag (n, T) hypothesis. In a second order analysis the steady
state Mach number is assumed to be small and the conserved equations are combined to get a
single partial differential equation which describes the behavior of the velocity
potential. A series of acoustic modes are used to expand the velocity potential. A system
of ordinary differential equations can be solved using this series. The final amplitude in
an unstable engine,triggering of instability by finite amplitude disturbances in a
linearly stable engine, and the shape of the pressure waves are predicted using numerical
calculations. The dependence of the engine parameters is reproduced with permission of the

of waves of moderate amplitude are all restrictions imposed on the second order theory. A
third order theory is developed to relax some of the restrictions. A system of partial
differential equations must be solved in order for the resulting equations to no longer be
reduced to a single equation. The behavior of a single mode is studied by approximating
each of the dependent variables as a function of the mode's spatial dependence. The
solutions are compared with those obtained from the second order analysis. The transfer of
energy between modes and the self-coupling of a mode were found to be important in
determining the stability characteristies of the system. The self-coupling mechanism was

Heterodyne detection of optical signals offers several advantages over other methods of
detection, including inherent gain and high discrimination against noise. To realize these
advantages, the optical heterodyning needs to be done efficiently. There are some
requirements on the alignment of the optical system. Performance indicators such as the
theterodyne receiver efficiency and signal-to- noise ratio are taken as performance
indicators in this research. The signal-to-noise ratio and receiver efficiency are defined
using an analytical approach. The signal and local oscillator field coherence are related
in a single expression. These expressions are applied to a communications link through a
turbulent atmosphere, a laser rough surface velocity measuring system, and a laser fluid
flow velocity measuring system. The signal field coherence function is derived from a

It is well-known that the far-field of an arbitrary antenna can be calculated. The
approach to far-field determination is not new, but two important questions remain
unanswered. How far apart should the sample points be? How can we reduce the amount of

applied to the near-field - measurement problem. The expansion of an arbitrary field as a

wavenumber spectrum is related to the amplitude of the field if it is specified over a

The measuring probe is known. Fourier transform techniques can be used to analyze the far-
field calculation problem if the electromagnetic field is measured on a plane located a
finite distance from an antenna. Waves with wavenumbers greater than 21T/A are attenuated
with increasing wavenumber and distance from the measurement plane. The sample spacing in
the near field can be chosen with the help of the sampling theorem from the analysis. At
infinite separation from the antenna, the sample spacing approaches an upper bound of X/2.
Low-pass spatial filters may be used to artificially affect wavenumber limiting. The
number of samples is reduced when the wavenumber limit of the low-pass filter decreases.
All information necessary to calculate the far-field pattern of the antenna is contained
in the wavenumber-limited data. The wavenumber limits of the low-pass filter affect the

The temporal properties of inhibition have been overlooked in favor of steady-state
conditions, even though they have been suggested to account for many visual phenomena.
There are some experiments that show the importance of excitatory and inhibitory
Transients. Transient responses are thought to be active in temporal phenomena of human
vision. To determine the role played by Transient inhibition in masking and metacontrast,
increment thresholds were needed. Since the effectiveness of a brief test flash is a
measure of the magnitude of the inhibitory Transient at various points in its time course,
the visual masking functions constructed from the threshold data represented an indirect
picture of the temporal course of lateral inhibition. The results showed that increasing
the illuminance of the masking annulus increased the magnitude and decreased the peak of
the masking functions. When the masking flash was increased by three log units, the peak
masking effect for three observers shifted from test flashes to the mask. The results of
the masking functions were compared with other visual masking theories. Permission was

This study is an extension of the existing analysis of macro- economic policy and the

incompatible with conditions of portfolio balance, it is argued that the analysis is only
applicable in the short-run. It is argued that current attempts to correct this deficiency
by imposing conditions of zero investment and constant asset stocks are just as bad as
descriptions of long- run equilibrium. A variant of the recently developed neoclassical
monetary growth model is used to analyze the long-run effects of government policy in a
situation of both portfolio balance of asset growth. Adding interest bearing government
debt and foreign financial assets to wealth portfolios is an extension of the model. It is

In terms of debt management policy, policy in terms of monetary and fiscal policy is in
favor of a specifi- cation. Government policy is defined in terms of three fundamental
policy variables, the level, rate of growth, and composition of government debt, as well
as three intermediate policy variables, the price level, the rate of inflation, and the
bond interest rate. The balance-of-payments effect of changes in the capital account
depends on the flow of interest earnings on foreign assets, which is roughly equal in size
to the flow of new foreign investment. There is a distinction between real and nominal
magnitudes and it is argued that capital flows at a constant income level are compatible
with portfolio equilibrium when price flexibility is introduced. Increasing the level of
government debt is shown to raise the level of capital outflow and decrease the trade
balance. The long-rur effects of changes in the composition of a given total debt on
international capital and trade flows are shown to be significant but directionally
uncertain. The influence of exchange rate flexibility is investigated, and it is shown
that different rates of inflation can be made compatible with balance-of-payments
equilibrium through an appropriate steady crawl of the exchange rate. Exchange rate
variation on interna- tional capital flows acting through capital gains or losses is

The thesis was directed by Associate Professor Theodore G. The aim of the study was to
demonstrate that isothermal reaction rates can be measured in a trickle-bed reactor.
Penetrating catalysts have been used in all previously reported trickle-bed studies.
Significant temperature gradients can exist when active catalyst is concentrated in a
small reactor volume, as shown by previous work. An attempt was made to eliminate the
resistances by using a catalyst consisting of palladium deposited on the surface of
irregular granules of a non-porous mineral, Reproduced with permission of the copyright

There is a substance called dolomite. In the reactor, the near-isothermal conditions were
maintained by diluting the active catalyst with dolomite which served as a heat sink and
liquid distributor. A bed height of 4.5 inches was used in a Pyrex reactor. The average
diameter was 1.61mm and the catalyst dilution ratio was 100 grams of catalyst to 600 grams
of dolomite. At one atmosphere hydrogen pressure, reaction rate data was obtained at 32,
40, and 50 C. The alpha-methylstyrene flowed at rates between 100 and 225cc./min. The flow
rate ranged from 1.0 to 2.5 liters/min. A gas chromatograph was used to determine effluent
liquid phase compo- sition. The catalyst activity decreased with time due to poisoning of
the catalyst surface by copper which had dissolved in the alpha-methylstyrene. The data
was described by a model which assumed plug flow in the liquid phase, the activity of the
catalyst decreases with time, and the surface reaction rate is first order in hydrogen
pressure. Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner, the calculated activation

the results of two rocket-borne spherical Langmuir probe experiments. The flights were

variation over the probe surface, probe velocity, and vehicle potential have been

The thesis examined the relationship between slow drift and smooth pursuit eye movements.
The low velocity system that corrects position errors during fixation of a stationary
target is the same system that controls smooth pursuit of a moving target. The present
study examined this suggestion by recording two-dimensional eye movements with a contact
lens-optical lever while 2 experienced subjects fixated and subsequently tracked a point
target suddenly set into motion in 8 unpredictable directions. A correlational technique
was used to determine the degree to which position errors were corrected. A procedure was
used to determine the direction of the chase. It was found that slow drift could be a
source of compensation for position errors during the fixation of a stationary target.
Prior research had shown that position errors can only be corrected parallel to a few
directions. The finding that 0.3 Sec drifts could be as effective as saccades in fixing
position errors was a new result. The targets were moved with the permission of the

Slow drifts became directionally uniform, moving the eye in the direction of the target at
slightly less than the target's speed. The drift direction was not influenced by the
direction of the target's movement. The changes in drift direction and velocity were seen
as evidence of a threshold for a smooth pursuit. The threshold was within the range of
drift velocities that were observed during the fixation of the target. This finding
supports the idea that a single low velocity control system is responsible for both
corrective drift and smooth pursuit. The present results were summarized in a model of low
velocity eve movement control. The model includes all low velocity eye movements within a
single framework. A source of noisy drifts, time-delay and low-pass components, and the
inability of the smooth eye movement system are some of the main feats of the model.

reduction is corre- late with the strain energies of the systems and is not compatible

entire half period of the RF at very low frequencies. The transit angle of the particles
increases as the frequencies increases. The defocusing phase interval increases as the
phase angle shifts in a positive direction. The use of posts at the exit side of the gap
improves the vertical focusing and makes it harder to focus in the horizontal direction.

William B. widhelm is an assistant professor of business administration at the University
of Maryland. The proposed models require the use of state variables to describe the
quality levels at various points in the system and transition matrices to describe the

systems. The design of systems for specified quality objectives, the selection of the
optimal means of producing the same output, and the establishment of quality oriteria are
some of the applications of this analysis. The models can be used to predict the effects
on the error-level distribution due to changes in the quality of incoming products, the
performance characteristics of the operators or machines, and the quality reviewers. The

A need not be normal is shown when a subset of the derived set is used. If we restrict the

stop the massive crystallization and microcrystalline clusters of meta at slightly lower

The beam ion energy is 80 eV, the ion density is 107 cm 3, the electron temperature is 1-2
eV, and the ion thermal speed is very small. The electron-ion temperature ratio, which is
near unity in flight and large in these experiments, is the only exception to the

peak on the centerline behind it. The sheath where the free stream ion velocity is closest

field, this interaction involves two-humped ion distribution functions, which may play a

An approximate analytical treatment is given for the problem of one-dimensional
infiltration into a porous medium. The air and water phases are considered. The treatment
is possible if capil - lary pressure can be neglected. With the assumption that capillary
pressure can be neglected, an equation involving saturation displacement and an average
total velocity is obtained. A second equation involving these two unknowns is obtained by
combining the capillary pressure relationship and the law of attraction for each phase.
These two relationships are solved in a way that yields the saturation profile and then
the infiltration rate. The soil properties and relationships that are required for the
analysis are porosity, intrinsic permeability, relative permeability versus saturation
relationships, and the capil- lary pressure versus saturation relationship. There are a
number of situations where infiltration rate curves can be obtained. Comparisions are made
with both experimental and finite difference results. The Richard Lee Brustkern Department

Polonium-210 is used as a radionuclide fuel for electrical generators and can be
accidentally released into agricultural soils. silt con- tent was correlated with the
absorption of 210 PoO2 in soils studied by bulk determination of distribution
coefficients. The equation for agricultural top soil absorption was derived from an
empirical equation. The empirical equation ln Kd was used to describe the distribution
coefficients of the combined data for the A, B and C horizons. The distribution
coefficients were successfully tested when polonium oxide was eluted through soil columns.
More than 98 percent of the PoO2 was retained by the first 2 cm of soil. Top soil samples
with less than 100 indicated PoO2 would be retained. There would be minimal risks to water
supplies from the movement of 210 Po through the soil. Positive and negative chemical
species were found in the soil solution. 34 per cent of the Po in the soil solution was
passed through a semi-permeable 210 membrane.

Consider the two-way classification model with one observation per cell, with the usual
identifiability and normality assumptions. When non- additivity in the model is shown to
be present, the procedure is to find a transformation which will make the transformed data
add up. If only for ease of interpretation, there is merit in analyzing the data in the
original units. To get a usable estimate of the error variance, it is recommended that you
examine the data to find the pattern of interaction. There are two solutions for analyzing
the data. It is assumed that the interaction is of the form Yij = raiy, for every i and j.
The maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters are obtained and the likelihood ratio
is derived. When there is no additivity in the data, an estimate of the error variance is
proposed. The second solution is a completely general procedure in which a theory of two
by two table differences is presented and then used to propose estimates of the error
variance that have desirable properties. The procedures are illustrated in two examples.

The use of RC networks has made active filters competitive with passive LC filters. The
application of active filters at higher pole frequencies has been limited by the
dependence on the open loop gain of the amplifier. The temperature and Frequency
limitations of active filters are serious. The dependence of the filter poles on the
finite, temperature- dependent gain-bandwidth product of the amplifier is the reason for
the limitations of the single amplifier filters. A new pole sensi- tivity measure is
defined. A quantitative figure of merit, IMP I, for integrated active filters, can be
obtained from this new sensitivity measure, which takes into account both the frequency
and temperature dependence of the amplifier. The sensitivity measure, Mp, depends on the
leading coefficients and the zeros of a specific driving point admittance of the passive
RC network. The minimum gain-bandwidth product required to realize a given transfer
function is determined. The identification of the specific passive network parameters
which affect the sensitivity measure results in a new synthesis procedure for the
realization of a given transfer function by an active filter with specified sensitivity
properties. Permission is required for further reproduction.

There is research directed toward developing coherent optical sources. The lack of high-
quality materials was one of the main obstacles. The phase diagram of the Li20 - No 205
system is explained in terms of the index of refraction inhomogeneities. The growth
techniques which led to high-quality, long crystals are presented. The first visible CW
optical parametric oscillator was constructed using such a crystal. The mally was lowered
from 0.68 to 0.705 microns at the signal, and 2.11 to 1.90 microns at the idler, because
of the multimode power of the argon ion laser. The signal and idler waves were heard. The
average signal power was -1 in a 3 cm bandwidth. An improved stability and con- version of

There is a need for student personnel services in higher education, but it has not been
possible to show that they are effective. During times of economic crises, student
personnel services are given a low priority in the allocation of resources. For those who
believe that student services are an important part of the instructional process, the only
way to survive is to develop ways to evaluate their effectiveness. Along with a
willingness to implement evaluation techniques, there must be a commitment on the part of
participants in the system being evaluated to change and improve in the directions
dictated by the findings. The purpose of this paper is to suggest an approach, ODAS, for
the evaluation of a student service, academic advising in particular, with the intent of
pointing the way to the development of a flexible, comprehensive system for evaluation of

From the beginning of the century, generalized continuity conditions for functions between
spaces have been studied. Recently, an increased interest has been taken in these
conditions weaker than continuity to explore the conditions themselves with their innate
properties and interrelationships and to use them as tools for defining certain classes of
topological spaces. Weak continuity and almost continuity are two of the prominent
independent generalized conti- nuity conditions. There are conditions for interdependence
of the two generalizations. A mapping condition combined with almost continuity will yield
continuity. It was known that weak continuity is equivalent to continuity. Here weak*
continuity is replaced by local weak* continuity, where a pure topo- logical version of
the closed graph theorem is obtained for a function into a strongly locally compact space.
The common basis for many of the theorems is shown in the literature. Thus.

A proposed reaction mechanism is examined for the generation of lectrochemiluminescence as
a consequence of the oxidation of an aromatic hydrocarbon in the presence of a bulk
reduction precursor. The reduction of aromatic hydrocarbon, a radical anion, causes the
decomposition of the bulk oxidant precursor into a reactive radical oxidant. There is an
excess of energy in the reaction that causes the neutral aromatic hydrocarbon to be
excited to the triplet energy state. The aromatic hydrocarbon has a cation radical formed
by the triplet state molecule. The cation radical undergoes an annihilation reaction with
an anion radical. There is excess energy in this reaction that can be used to excite a
molecule. If the amount of excess energy is large enough, the lowest excited singlet state
is produced and luminescence is detected from its decay, otherwise a triplet state is
formed again. The former luminescing occurs when the population of triplet molecules
increases. Permission is required for further reproduction.

There are four identifiable approaches to multiplication instruction that have been taken

approaches. Two of the three remaining methods have been compared with respect to their
relative effectiveness in facilitating recall of the facts and comprehension of the
concept of multi-plication. There have been conflicting results from these comparisons.
The last method has not been re- searched. The primary objective of the study was to
compare three approaches to multiplication instruction and to determine their relative
efficacy when recalling the basic multiplication facts. Three treatments were designed to
be representative of the three approaches to multiplication instruction: Treatment T,
